A,A.K. Gourmet House Private Limited,"149, Second Floor, Kilokari",Mr. Arjun Thakur,Director,arjunthakur@ohnuts.in,"Oh! Nuts – Revolutionizing Healthy Snacking
The desire for a healthier yet delicious snacking option led two friends to create something truly unique—Oh! Nuts. More than just a brand, it represents a shift in the snacking industry, offering a perfect balance of taste and nutrition. What started as a simple yet innovative idea—crafting chips directly from real nuts—has grown into a movement redefining the way people snack.

Oh! Nuts delivers a guilt-free indulgence with non-fried, gluten-free, and protein-rich chips that contain 70% less oil than traditional snacks and are completely free from preservatives. Each pack is designed to provide an optimal daily intake of nuts, making every bite both enjoyable and nutritionally fulfilling. With Oh! Nuts, snacking is no longer a compromise but a delightful and healthy experience.

The overwhelming response from consumers and retailers has fueled our rapid expansion into the market. Since our launch, Oh! Nuts has built a strong presence across Delhi NCR and Chandigarh Tricity, securing placements in premium retail chains and standalone stores. Our strategic partnerships has further strengthened our offline distribution, ensuring that our products are readily available to a growing audience. With each new point of sale, we are inching closer to our vision of making nutritious snacking accessible to all.

Our journey has been met with industry recognition and invaluable support. Oh! Nuts was selected as one of the nine startups in the first cohort of Nikhil Kamath's WTFund, receiving Rs. 20L grant and standing out as the only consumer brand in the batch. Additionally, we were awarded a grant under the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme, reinforcing the belief in our vision and enabling us to scale with confidence. These milestones serve as a testament to our commitment to innovation and quality in the food space.

Oh! Nuts is more than just a snack—it's a statement. A statement that healthy eating should never come at the cost of taste, and that better choices should be available to everyone. As we continue to grow, we remain dedicated to transforming the snacking industry, one delicious, nutrient-packed bite at a time.",1

-	Contemporary renditions of traditional crafts
-	Maintains Authenticity of crafts
-	Ensures quality at an optimal price

-	Enables co-creation & engagement
-	Empowerment of artisans
-	Socializing handlooms amongst wider audience, specially the youths

Aditri leverages latest digital marketing tools - Influencer marketing, SEO/SMM and has significant presence of social media channels. 

The brand has made significant strides under incubation with NFDI - Revenue growth: Growth of over 100% revenue, FY 2023-24 to in FY 2024-25.

Focus on innovation in handlooms: Some of the notable areas of work include gas mercerized cotton, natural vegetable dyes for Ikat sarees, development of new nontraditional colours (pastel shades) in Baluchari sarees etc.  

Growth in direct and indirect employment: Aditri's direct employees have grown to 8 personnel and has engaged more than 300+ weavers in saree production. 

Aditri is actively working on leveraging cutting edge digital AR/VR along with AI technology for superlative user experience.

1. The Vision:
-------------
Our passion for farmers, and our concern that technology is not percolating down to them, drove us to start AgCane.  We are of the strong belief that  - for its mass adoption  -  technology needs to be solutionized for our farmers.

Our vision is to intervene and make a real difference here - To be a bridge between the cutting edge in Agri-tech and the reality on the ground. To do our part in nation building.  Our mantra is - “Solutionizing Technology for the Farmer and the Agri-Ecosystem”.  Enabling. Sustainable.  

2. The Ground Connect:
--------------------------
True to this, we spent the initial 2 years - not on technology, but in doing farming, to become farmers and to understand their world. 

We worked with over 500 farmers across 50+ villages, and enabled transition of more than 1500 acres of cultivation from paddy to sugarcane, thereby increasing incomes and improving sustainability for these farmers. We also enabled a smooth and timely supply of quality seedlings to the farmers, delivered at their farms, supporting over 4000 acres. 

Working amidst the grime and dust, away from the comfort of our offices, we were committed to exploring the issues first-hand. This exposure was extremely critical for obtaining insights into the real nature of problems and the constraints involved, paving the way for experimenting and Solutionizing. Our Products CropScan and HarvestView - have evolved based on ground realities and our first-hand experiences.

3. CropScan :  Increasing Crop Yield through Technology
-----------------------------------------------------------
Our flagship CropScan product primarily uses Space technology such as satellite based remote sensing,  GIS, GPS , hyperlocal weather along with  AI/ML, Image processing, Cloud & Mobile technologies to provide regular crop growth and crop irrigation Visibility, measurability and feedback  mechanisms and information to the farmer on his mobile.  This enables the farmer and the supporting ecosystem to improve yield, reduce losses and optimize expenses in a sustainable and affordable way,

Further, CropScan is also designed for organizations, wherein hierarchy based field teams can centrally monitor crop health and crop activities for thousands of plots, track field visits, and derive valuable analytics (dashboards/reports) – providing irrefutable, timely and consistent data to the team and management, to enable corrective action and data-driven decision making.   

4. HarvestView: Smart Harvesting through Technology 
---------------------------------------------------------
HarvestView from AgCane is another cloud-based SaaS platform for organizations and harvesting service providers to know about the extent of crop availability, the harvesting progress and the expected yield.

The product primarily use Space technology such as satellite based remote sensing,  GIS, GPS ,  AI/ML, Image processing, Cloud & Mobile technologies.

This delay leads to preventable health complications, sometimes turning minor symptoms into serious conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and chronic illnesses. In these regions, low health literacy further compounds the problem—many people fail to recognize the importance of consulting a specialist doctor at the right time. Moreover, the language barrier is a major obstaclei, making it difficult to communicate symptoms accurately and understand medical advice. These gaps in healthcare access lead to misdiagnosis, worsening conditions, and preventable fatalities, creating an urgent need for an efficient, accurate, and accessible solution.

AIMSwasthya is revolutionizing healthcare by leveraging artificial intelligence to provide instant, accurate, and language-friendly medical recommendations. The platform enables users to describe their symptoms in their own language. Our AI-driven symptom analysis processes these inputs and instantly recommends the most relevant specialist for their condition, ensuring that people reach the right doctor without delay. Unlike random online searches, self-diagnosing, or relying solely on general practitioners, AIMSwasthya helps users skip confusion and make smarter health decisions faster.

Key features of AIMSwasthya include AI-powered symptom analysis, which allows users to enter their symptoms and receive accurate specialist recommendations instantly. The platform supports multiple languages, making healthcare accessible. It eliminates the need for unreliable Google searches by providing precise medical recommendations within seconds. By bridging the specialist gap, AIMSwasthya ensures that people even in rural and semi-urban areas have access to expert doctors, reducing delays in treatment. The platform focuses on preventive and early diagnosis, helping individuals identify potential health risks before they escalate. It also reduces the chances of misdiagnosis or treatment delays by directing patients to the appropriate specialist from the start.

The vision of AIMSwasthya is to create a future where no one suffers due to delayed diagnosis, lack of awareness, or language barriers. Every individual, regardless of their location, language, or education level, deserves access to the right healthcare at the right time. The mission of AIMSwasthya is to make specialist care more accessible, reduce avoidable health risks. By combining technology with healthcare accessibility, AIMSwasthya is working toward a healthier India where early diagnosis and the right medical intervention become the norm rather than the exception.",5

With over 35 years of experience and a proprietary process, the company transforms natural cotton into biodegradable, moldable, and unbreakable sculptures. It is India's first company to offer cotton-based religious idols, home decor pieces, and personalized gifting sculptures at scale.

The firm's flagship creation, Cotton Ganesha, offers an eco-conscious alternative to traditional Plaster of Paris (PoP) and clay idols. These cotton idols are lightweight, unbreakable, and water-soluble, dissolving without harming the environment. Crafted using treated natural cotton fibers and finished with organic pigments, every sculpture balances spiritual tradition and environmental responsibility.

The company's ethos, “Where Art Breathes Naturally,” reflects its commitment to zero-waste artistry, promoting conscious celebration while preserving cultural heritage.

Flagship Product: Cotton GaneshaGanesh Chaturthi, widely celebrated across India and by the global Indian diaspora, has long depended on PoP idols that pollute water bodies with non-biodegradable, toxic residues. Although clay is a safer option, it is fragile and logistically difficult to transport.

Cotton Ganesha addresses this environmental issue head-on. These idols are:

100% biodegradable and water-soluble

Lightweight and easy to transport

Unbreakable and safe to handle

Safe for aquatic life and natural ecosystems

Each idol is handcrafted with care, maintaining traditional design values while eliminating the ecological footprint. Cotton Ganesha is ideal for eco-conscious individuals, families, corporates, NGOs, and spiritual communities.

Product Applications

Religious Idols for Ganesh Chaturthi and pujas

Custom Eco-Friendly Gifting (corporate and personal)

Home Decor Sculptures (cultural and spiritual themes)

Luxury Art Installations (hotels, institutions, galleries)

Environmental Impact
By replacing PoP idols with Cotton Ganesha, the company helps:

Prevent chemical pollution of water bodies

Protect aquatic life from toxic waste

Eliminate long-degrading plaster residue

Lower transport emissions via lightweight materials

Support sustainable festival practices

The idols dissolve completely, leaving behind only biodegradable fiber traces. No synthetic additives or plastic residues are used in any step.

Market Size & Opportunity
India's idol market exceeds INR 300 crore annually, with over 20 crore idols sold each Ganesh Chaturthi. Major cities have seen doubling demand for eco-friendly idols. Governments are gradually enforcing PoP bans, increasing adoption of sustainable alternatives.

In the USA, UAE, and other global hubs with significant Indian populations, PoP idols face import restrictions, creating strong demand for lightweight, eco-safe alternatives. Cotton Ganesha, being easy to ship and customs-friendly, has a natural edge.

Meanwhile, India's gifting industry is expected to hit USD 65 billion by 2025, driven by personalized, sustainable products. Cotton sculptures offer an elegant, handmade gifting option with artistic and environmental value.

Growth Potential
Anant Kotton Sculptures LLP is strategically positioned for growth, supported by:

Patented manufacturing technology

First-mover advantage in cotton-based sculptures

Increasing environmental regulations favoring biodegradable materials

Growing preference for unique, eco-conscious gifts and decor

Strong opportunities in domestic and global festive markets

Planned expansion includes:

E-commerce scaling through own site and marketplaces

Retail tie-ups and corporate gifting channels

Government collaborations for green festivals

Global outreach to diaspora markets and sustainable art forums

Recognitions

Guinness World Record for largest cotton wool sculpture

Featured in Limca Book of Records

Felicitated by the President of India

In recent years, there has been a huge up-surge of interest in mushrooms as a source of new compounds capable of improving biological functions and in activities related to the use of mushroom products for dietary supplements and other medicinal purposes. Furthermore, the application of modem analytical techniques 
is establishing scientific bases for empirical observations made centuries before. From the last two decades, there is growing experimentally based evidence suggesting that the consumption of mushrooms as a functional food, or through the use of extracted bioactive compounds as dietary supplement, increases resistance to diseases and in some cases also causes regression of a diseased state. In many cases, these practices are thought to enhance the immune response of the human body, which is often weakened as a result of exposure to increasing levels of stress causes by present day high-pressure work demands. The first are oyster (Pleurotus) mushrooms. They are a class of mushrooms that are common throughout the world, easy to cultivate, and pack a nutritious punch. Common oyster varieties include blue oyster, king oyster, black pearl and golden oyster. Mushrooms have been part of the human diet for a long time and are an important source of nutrients and essential bioactive compounds. Due to their short shelf life period, it's difficult to store them for long periods without processing. Among all the mushrooms, Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) is the second most consumed and cultivated edible mushroom in the world. It is a high protein, low fat, low energy food being a good source of dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals. Mushrooms have a characteristic aroma, delicious taste and nutraceutical value. The characteristic aroma and taste is due to various volatile and non-volatile compounds present in mushroom.
Mushrooms have a characteristic aroma, delicious taste and nutraceutical value. The characteristic aroma and taste is due to various volatile and non-volatile compounds present in mushroom. But we are concerned with the extraction of volatile aromatic compounds which are mainly responsible for the flavour and aroma of mushrooms. They belong to chemical groups of hydrocarbons, phenols, alcohols, heterocyclic, acids and their derivatives, Carbonyl (Aldehydes and Ketones), and sulphur sulphur-containing molecules. The main volatile compound responsible for the taste and flavour of mushrooms is aliphatic alcohol ‘1-octen-3-ol' which is also called ‘mushroom alcohol'. The blend of these volatile compounds has excellent sensory properties (strong flavours and delicious taste) which can be used to develop flavoring agents and increase the palatability of food items. As the international market for flavoring agents is soaring, we are developing a mushroom liquid aromatic extract by focusing on volatile compounds in mushrooms. At present, petrochemical-based solvents are used to extract natural components and used as natural flavoring agents. Synthetic flavours are made of chemical compounds which may contain toxic impurities. These compounds are neither good for the human body nor for the environment. We use vacuum distillation technique in the processing of fresh oyster mushroom.",8

Founded on June 20, 2011, ATGC Biotech Pvt. Ltd. has established itself as a leader in the field of biotechnological innovations, specifically in the development and production of insect pheromones for integrated pest management. Based in Hyderabad, India, the company is dedicated to providing eco-friendly solutions to agricultural pest problems, thereby reducing the dependency on traditional chemical pesticides.

Innovative Product Line
ATGC Biotech's core expertise lies in its sophisticated synthesis methods that produce high-quality pheromones with exceptional isomeric purity. This ensures precise species-specific targeting, which is crucial for the effective management of pest populations in various agricultural settings. The company's product range includes a variety of pheromone blends tailored for mass trapping and mating disruption techniques. These products are designed to attract specific insect pests, thereby preventing them from breeding and significantly reducing their populations in crop fields.

CREMIT Technology: A Sustainable Revolution
A standout innovation from ATGC Biotech is the Controlled Release Enhanced Mating Interruption Technology (CREMIT). This cutting-edge approach is based on the concept of ‘Insect Family Planning,' which strategically disrupts the mating patterns of pests. CREMIT's technology encapsulates pheromones in a biodegradable matrix that slowly releases them over an extended period, ensuring long-lasting effectiveness and minimal environmental impact. By employing CREMIT, farmers can achieve superior pest control, resulting in higher crop yields and quality.

Sustainable Impact and Environmental Commitment
ATGC Biotech is committed to sustainability, not only through its products but also in its operational practices. The introduction of pheromone-based solutions has allowed for a substantial reduction in the use of harmful insecticides, which benefits both the environment and the communities involved in farming. The decreased chemical residue in crops leads to safer food products and a healthier ecosystem.

Future Outlook and Expansion
Looking forward, ATGC Biotech continues to invest in research and development to expand its product lines and explore new applications of pheromone technology in agriculture. The company aims to broaden its impact by reaching more farmers across India and internationally, promoting sustainable agricultural practices globally.

As ATGC Biotech moves towards a future where sustainable farming is paramount, it remains dedicated to innovation, quality, and the well-being of the planet. Its efforts in advancing pheromone technology reflect a significant step forward in achieving agricultural sustainability and food security for generations to come

About Us
Ak Farming is an agritech company committed to bringing innovative and cost-effective solutions to farmers. Founded by Ajay Solanki, the company focuses on automating irrigation processes to save time, labor, and water while increasing farming efficiency.

We specialize in automated irrigation products, particularly the Timer Valve, a fully mechanical system that makes flood irrigation completely automatic—without requiring electricity or batteries. Our goal is to help farmers transition to modern farming methods without high costs or technical complexities.

Our Vision
At Ak Farming, we envision a future where farmers no longer struggle with manual irrigation management. Our mission is to create affordable, reliable, and easy-to-use solutions that improve productivity and sustainability in agriculture. We believe that smart irrigation technology can transform farming, making it more efficient, resource-friendly, and profitable.
Our Key Product – The Timer Valve
The Timer Valve is an innovative irrigation automation device designed to simplify flood irrigation for farmers. It is a 100% mechanical valve that controls water distribution without any external power source.

🔹 How It Works:

Farmers install 5-10 Timer Valves in front of their irrigation beds.

The valve is set to a specific time for watering each section of the field.

Once water flows into the valve, the timer starts and allows irrigation for the set duration.

After the time is up, the valve automatically diverts water to the next section, eliminating manual labor.

🔹 Why Farmers Love It:
✅ No Electricity Needed – Works entirely on mechanical operation.
✅ Reduces Labor Costs – No need to monitor irrigation manually.
✅ Saves Water – Prevents over-irrigation and reduces wastage.
✅ Affordable & Durable – A one-time investment that lasts for years.
✅ Easy to Use – Simple setup, no technical expertise required.

Our Timer Valve replaces the need for human supervision, making irrigation fully automatic, efficient, and stress-free.

Why Choose Ak Farming?
🚀 Innovation in Agriculture – We develop practical and farmer-friendly solutions.
💰 Cost-Effective Solutions – Our products are designed to be affordable yet highly efficient.
🌱 Sustainability Focus – We prioritize water conservation and labor reduction.
📈 Trusted by Farmers – Our technology is field-tested and widely adopted.

We believe that every drop of water counts, and by automating irrigation, we empower farmers to make better use of resources while increasing their crop yield.

Other Products & Services
Apart from the Timer Valve, Ak Farming is actively engaged in reselling high-margin agricultural products through social media marketing. We help farmers access quality farming tools and equipment at competitive prices, ensuring they get the best value for their investment.",12

Long-term pest control without resistance build-up
Improved crop health and productivity
Zero harmful residues, making produce export-friendly

The unsolved problems of young parents and their kids' drink
Children want to drink some tea or tea-like beverage along with their parents, when parents drink their tea.
This scenario has been repeated for generations.
We, BARNAA, exist to provide solutions for caffeine-free children's tea.

There is a lack of specific tea or tea-like beverage suitable for children; either it is not available or not made in the market. Though children want to drink some tea or tea-like beverage along with their parents, when parents drink their tea,. It is common for children, in many houses, to show a strong interest in tea when they see their parents enjoying a cup of tea. Some children express curiosity, while others can be quite persistent, eager to emulate their parents and partake in the tea-drinking ritual. With few alternatives available, parents sometimes feel forced to give their children unhealthy choices. Many resort to diluting their own tea with milk to satisfy their children's curiosity, or they offer sugary drinks available in the market as a substitute. These drinks are high in sugar, caffeine, and artificial ingredients, potentially leading to issues like obesity and hyperactivity. This scenario has been repeated for generations, with most of us having experienced the same longing for tea during childhood, only to be told to wait until we were older. The challenge lies in the fact that, despite children's desire to drink tea, there is no tea specifically designed for them available on the market. WE are generations of health-conscious parents. Increasing awareness among parents about the negative impact of sugary and caffeinated beverages, leading to a demand for healthier alternatives. BARNAA exists to provide solutions to caffeine-free children's tea, a healthy, nutritious beverage, made by blending plant-based superfoods, herbs, and spices, with zero added sugar, specifically designed and suitable for children. One-stop solution for tea for all family members.

life.The turning point of my life came in Delhi when I desired to re-create the soul-nourishing Himalayan food that I had grown up on.”

Evolution—how it began
Aditi is originally from Darjeeling brought up in a joint family of 14 members, but has been based in Delhi for most of her professional life. In Delhi, Aditi missed the authentic, traditional Himalayan cuisine on which she had grown up. She and her husband often spoke of venturing into a business that offers healthy, hygienic and affordable food but they couldn't prioritize these ideas because of the pressures of living in Delhi. Around 2013 they moved to Jaipur and being a good cook, her husband nudged her to compete in the 2013 Amul Master Chef, which she did and was shortlisted among the Top Six. 


This experience was an eye-opener for Aditi. It brought to life the influence of culture, religion, ethnicity, regional techniques, and ingredients on cuisine. It reinforced her desire to use her culinary passion to build cross-cultural integration and promote food innovation. 

Kitchen Ke Superstar,as it was called during Masterchef Season 3 a popular cooking show in Hindi. She met the famous restaurateur and chef Vikas Khanna, who affectionately gave her the name Momo Mami, by which she is referred.

Before 2016,Aditi had a few unsuccessful attempts at venturing out on her own, and finally, with co-founders, she started and registered BluePine Foods Pvt. Ltd. in Delhi with the promise of offering customers healthy, affordable and hygienic momos. In 2018, the company opened its first Quick Service Restaurant, Yangkiez By Momo Mami, which was also Aditi's name before marriage.

We are in deep trouble because of climate crisis whose main cause is global warming because of extremely high carbon footprint of human population. In last 90 years human population has spoiled the environment more than our ancestors did in 1500 years prior to that, because of our irresponsible activities. Consumer goods used by individuals and organizations contribute 40% to the overall carbon footprint of the world. Conventional products have a much higher carbon footprint than cleantech products. 
Now It's time for 8.1 Bn people of world to follow responsible consumption and a low carbon lifestyle in order to reduce Green House Gas effect and save the environment for us and our future generations. Its most urgent for the world! We are on a mission to make cleantech products easily accessible to entire population of the world.

Brand 1: Cleantech Mart: 
We at Cleantech Mart (by IDEALERS B2B PVT LTD) have a mission to foster a habit of responsible consumption and a low carbon footprint lifestyle among the global population, thereby reducing the overall Carbon footprint of the world.

Brand 3: CM-AI 
The biggest problem the world is facing today is climate crisis caused mainly by global warming due to exponential rise in Carbon Footprint of individuals and organizations. Every product and service that we use has a carbon footprint, which needs to be measured so that we can either reduce it or offset it. This is an urgent activity if we have to reach Net Zero by 2050.
The current approach to calculating the carbon footprint (CF) of a product, known as Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), is both expensive and time-consuming. Due to the lack of more affordable methods, most manufacturers opt not to conduct CF analyses for their products.
Solution:
By leveraging LLMs, CMAI can create a powerful tool that democratizes carbon footprint analysis, making it accessible and affordable for manufacturers of all sizes. This will differentiate Cleantech products from similar conventional products. This aligns with the mission of IDEALERS B2B PVT LTD to foster responsible consumption, low-carbon lifestyle among global population.",4

C,Cortex N Grey Technologies,"Room No:401,CfHE,TIP Building,IIT-Hyderabad",Mr. Pramod S,Pramod S,pramod.s@cfhe.iith.ac.in,"About Us: Cortex N Grey Technologies
Cortex N Grey Technologies is a purpose-driven med-tech startup on a mission to reshape early childhood developmental care by harnessing the power of AI, neuroscience, and play. We are focused on building innovative, culturally rooted, and scalable tools for early screening of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs), including Autism, ADHD, Learning Disabilities (LD), and Intellectual Disabilities (ID) — all through natural child interactions and sensor-integrated play.
Our journey began with a powerful realization: in India, over 99% of children with developmental delays are screened too late, often after the critical brain development period between ages 2 and 3. This delay leads to missed opportunities for early intervention, stigmatization,  and long-term educational and social challenges. We saw an urgent need — and an opportunity — to change the system from the ground up.
At Cortex N Grey, we don't just screen children. We empower their futures.
Our Solution: Play. Sense. Detect. Empower.
We have developed an AI-powered, sensor-based play system that aligns with psychomotor cues from validated clinical screening tools. Our technology enables early detection of behavioral, cognitive, motor, and emotional patterns in children — all through the most natural medium for a child: play.
What makes us different:
•	Hybrid Screening Model: 60% on-screen gamified activities and 40% real-world, sensor-integrated toys for a complete child profile.
•	AI-Driven Analysis: Our backend algorithms analyze behavior in real time and provide custom developmental reports.
•	Gamified Engagement: Children engage in play while we unobtrusively capture key screening cues.
•	Smart Dashboard: Paediatricians, Caregivers, therapists, and educators receive insights, reports, and customized intervention suggestions.
•	Culturally Adaptive: Games and themes are built around Indian folk stories and languages, increasing child engagement and accessibility.
This approach bridges the gap between clinical screening tools and the real-world child environment, removing stigma, increasing accessibility, and capturing data that traditional questionnaires miss.

Our Vision
To create a world where no child is left behind due to delayed diagnosis. We aim to become India's leading innovation in early neurodevelopmental screening and therapy, ensuring every child receives support during the brain's golden window of development.
The Problem We Solve
•	Late Screening: Most children in India are brought for assessment only after age 5 or 6, missing the critical neurodevelopmental phase.
•	Lack of Tools at Grassroots: PHCs, pediatric clinics, and schools lack access to objective, easy-to-use screening tools.
•	Stigma and Awareness Gaps: Parents and teachers often fail to notice subtle signs or avoid action due to social stigma.
•	Overdependence on Clinical Settings: Traditional methods rely on subjective questionnaires, require experts, and are often language-restricted.
We bring the solution closer to the child, into homes, schools, and anganwadis — without needing a psychologist present at every site.
Our Impact Potential
Children: Early diagnosis means timely support, better academic outcomes, and enhanced emotional and social growth.
Teachers: Equipped with tools to understand learning patterns and support differently-abled learners.
Healthcare Workers: Objective data and actionable insights 
Parents: Awareness, acceptance, and confidence to seek support earlier, without stigma.
Achievements So Far
•	Listed among Top 20 in ZS Prize 2023 (India's leading healthcare innovation challenge)
•	Prototyping and clinical research support from ICMR, Hospitals, and MeitY TIDE 2.0 and CfHE-IITH
•	Collaborations with pediatricians, psychologists, child development centers, and inclusive education NGOs



Our Team
We are a team of passionate technologists, neuroscientists, designers, and therapists — led by founders with deep expertise in IoT, Embedded Systems, AI, and child development. We are mentored by child psychiatrists and backed by a strong network of institutional and field partners.
Our Ask from Mahakumbh
•	Deploy our pilot at scale in schools, PHCs, and developmental centers
•	Complete large-scale field validation
•	Refine and launch our full-stack product across India
•	Partner with state education and health departments to integrate into screening schedules
We are seeking support in terms of mentorship, grants, strategic partnerships, and access to early adopters.

C,Crease Inda,"IX-6175, Partap Gali, Jain Mandir gali no. 1",Mr. Udit Vij,Co-Founder,creaseindiaofficial@gmail.com,"Crease India is more than just a clothing label—it's a modern movement redefining Indian menswear for the conscious, confident man. Founded in 2023 by two friends and fashion professionals, Anand Nema and Udit Vij, Crease India was born out of a shared vision: to create timeless designer clothing that blends heritage with modernity, and quality with affordability.

The journey began in 2012, when the founders met as students of Fashion Merchandising and Retail Management at FDDI. Over time, both pursued careers in fashion and e-commerce, gaining valuable experience across the industry. One entered his family's traditional clothing business; the other ventured into the digital world, freelancing in social media and e-commerce marketing. Despite following different paths, they shared a common frustration with the state of menswear in India. Designer clothing was either unaffordable or disconnected from India's rich cultural identity. Fast fashion was growing rapidly, but so was its environmental cost.

Crease India was created to challenge that norm.

In a world driven by speed, trends, and mass production, we believe in slowing down and focusing on what matters: quality, design, and legacy. We set out to build a brand that brings luxury menswear to the everyday man—without compromising on craftsmanship, comfort, or culture.

Our collections are designed for all of life's important moments—weddings, boardroom meetings, religious functions, festive nights, and celebrations. Whether you're dressing for tradition or making a statement in a modern setting, Crease India offers versatile pieces that elevate your presence and reflect your story.

We proudly design and produce in India, drawing inspiration from our roots while infusing each garment with contemporary aesthetics. Every item is crafted using high-quality fabrics that are breathable, durable, and stylish. From structured Nehru jackets and festive kurtas to statement shirts and everyday essentials, our designs reflect a seamless blend of sophistication and ease.

But our mission goes beyond clothing. We're building a platform for personal expression, cultural pride, and conscious fashion. We aim to make designer menswear accessible to every Indian man—not just those who can afford luxury labels inflated by heavy advertising and branding. We focus on delivering premium quality at honest prices by cutting out the middlemen and connecting directly with our audience through our website and online platforms.

Sustainability is not just a trend for us—it's a responsibility. We recognize the environmental damage caused by fast fashion and are committed to creating garments that last longer, waste less, and age gracefully. As we grow, we plan to integrate eco-friendly and body-conscious fabrics such as bamboo, hemp, and khadi into our collections. Every decision we make is rooted in a vision to build a better, more responsible future for fashion.

At Crease India, we believe every man deserves to feel confident, comfortable, and culturally connected in what he wears. That's why each piece we create is more than fabric and thread—it's a story, a legacy, a reflection of who you are.

We're not here to follow trends. We're here to leave a mark.
To design garments that become part of your milestones.
To redefine what it means to dress like a modern Indian gentleman.
To remind the world that true style doesn't fade—it evolves with purpose.

ARD Bio Tech LLP is a pioneering green tech startup dedicated to revolutionizing agriculture and waste management through innovation and sustainability. Our core mission is to transform organic waste into valuable agricultural inputs that help boost crop yields, enhance soil health, and contribute to a cleaner environment.

Our Innovative Solution:
We have developed a patented, eco-friendly process that converts organic waste—specifically chicken feathers, human hair, and coconut coir—into a nutrient-rich organic liquid fertilizer. Our technology is founded on 8+ years of intensive research and development, during which we designed and perfected specialized machinery to ensure 100% waste utilization with zero by-products. This closed-loop, zero-waste approach not only addresses the pressing issue of waste disposal but also provides a sustainable alternative to chemical fertilizers.

Key Benefits of Our Fertilizer:

Tailored Nutrition: Our fertilizer is uniquely formulated to meet the specific nutritional needs of crops at different growth phases. This customization eliminates the guesswork for farmers, ensuring that each crop receives the optimal mix of nutrients for maximum organic yield.

Yield Enhancement: Field trials have demonstrated that our fertilizer can boost crop yields by up to 85%, offering farmers the same level of productivity as chemical fertilizers but without the associated environmental risks.

Eco-Friendly Production: By converting waste materials into a high-performance product, we not only reduce environmental pollution but also promote sustainable agricultural practices.

Cost-Effective: Our solution provides an affordable alternative to conventional fertilizers, reducing input costs while improving profitability for farmers.

Our Market Opportunity:
The global demand for sustainable agricultural solutions is growing rapidly as farmers and governments seek environmentally responsible alternatives to chemical inputs. With increasing awareness of soil degradation and the detrimental effects of chemical fertilizers, our product is well-positioned to capture significant market share both domestically and internationally. By integrating waste management with agricultural innovation, we address two critical challenges simultaneously, creating a unique value proposition for farmers, cooperatives, and policy makers.

Growth and Scalability:
Our patented technology, combined with our in-house engineered machinery, provides a scalable platform that can be rapidly deployed across various agricultural regions. We are focused on building strong partnerships with agricultural cooperatives, government bodies, and distributors to expand our reach. Moreover, our business model—centered around sustainable, high-yield, zero-waste fertilizer—positions us for rapid market adoption, making ARD Bio Tech LLP a leader in the green agriculture revolution.

Our Vision:
We envision a future where organic waste is no longer a burden but a valuable resource that fuels sustainable growth. Our goal is to empower farmers with a product that not only maximizes crop productivity but also rejuvenates soil health and protects the environment. We aim to create a circular economy in agriculture—one that turns waste into wealth, reduces dependency on harmful chemicals, and fosters long-term ecological balance.

Why Choose ARD Bio Tech LLP?

Proven Expertise: With over 8 years of dedicated R&D, our team brings deep technical knowledge and innovative spirit to every stage of our process.

Unmatched Innovation: We are the first in the world to integrate diverse organic wastes into a single, high-performance fertilizer, backed by robust patent protection and field-tested results.

Sustainability at the Core: Our 100% pollution-free, closed-loop production process not only delivers superior agricultural performance but also makes a significant positive impact on the environment.

Market-Ready: Our scalable solution is designed to meet the growing demand for sustainable agriculture, providing farmers with the tools they need to thrive in an increasingly eco-conscious marketplace.

D,Diatomic,"A-16, Gali no 2, Mahipalpur Extention",Mr. Ajay Girotra,CEO,ajay@diatomic.life,"DIATOMIC HEALTHCARE: The Global Pioneer in Oxygen Delivery Innovation

Diatomic Healthcare Private Limited. It is an innovation-driv enterprise dedicated to solving one of the most fundamental and under-recognized global health challenges: oxygen deficiency. With its flagship invention Ox66®—the world's first solid, ingestible, and topical oxygen supplement—Diatomic is redefining how oxygen is delivered to the body and applied across industries.

For billions worldwide, oxygen deficiency is an invisible crisis. Pollution, respiratory disorders, urban stress, sedentary habits, and chronic illnesses have created widespread, undiagnosed hypoxia at the cellular level. While oxygen remains the most essential molecule for life, traditional oxygen therapies are confined to clinical or emergency settings. Diatomic seeks to make oxygen as accessible and portable as a daily supplement—transforming it from an emergency measure into a proactive solution.

The Breakthrough: Ox66® – Oxygen in a Capsule
Ox66® is a GRAS-approved, clathrate-poly oxygenated compound that releases molecular oxygen upon ingestion or topical application. Unlike traditional oxygen that requires inhalation, Ox66® delivers oxygen directly to the bloodstream and tissues through the digestive or dermal pathway. This innovation bypasses lung limitations, enabling oxygen delivery even in patients with impaired respiratory function.

Ox66® is:

• Non-toxic and scientifically safe
• Portable, requiring no oxygen cylinders or concentrators
• Designed for everyday use as a nutraceutical or topical aid
• Suitable for use in both clinical and non-clinical settings

Product Formats
Diatomic has introduced Ox66® in a variety of formats to suit specific needs:

• Oral Capsules (30-day bottles & 6-capsule pouches)
• Topical Sprays & Mists (for facial and body application)
• Oxygen Creams & Gels (for skin repair, pain relief, and rejuvenation)
• Industrial, Fuel, and Agri-grade variants (in the advanced pilot stage)

Wide-Reaching Applications
1. Healthcare & Chronic Disease Support

Ox66® helps manage oxygen-related symptoms in:

COPD, asthma, and respiratory stress
Anaemia, fatigue, and metabolic disorders
PCOS/PCOD and hormonal imbalance
Long COVID, brain fog, and post-viral fatigue
Sleep apnea, circulation issues, and diabetic complications
2. Wellness & Lifestyle

Used in wellness spas and clinics, Ox66®:

Enhances energy, vitality, and skin glow
Supports cognitive clarity and sleep quality
Offers anti-aging benefits through improved oxygenation
3. Sports, Fitness & Altitude Use

Ox66® supports:

Endurance athletes and gym-goers
Mountaineers and trekkers at high altitudes
Military personnel operating in low-oxygen environments
4. Defense, Emergency & First Responders

Ideal for:

Armed forces and paramilitary units in high-altitude posts

5. Pollution Protection & Urban Oxygen Support

In cities with high AQI, Ox66® acts as a personal oxygen buffer for:

6. Environmental, Agricultural & Industrial R&D

Under active research for:

Use as a fuel additive for cleaner combustion

D,Dinetimz Pvt Ltd,"356,Masakin-e-saifiya,(bijalpur)",Mr. Idrees Ali JabalpurWala,Founder,dine.timz@gmail.com,"Dinetimz is a tech-driven tiffin and mess aggregator platform designed to revolutionize how students and working professionals access affordable and flexible meal options. Unlike traditional mess services that lock users into a single vendor for an entire month, Dinetimz allows seamless vendor switching under a single subscription plan, ensuring variety, quality, and user satisfaction.

By leveraging AI-powered insights, our platform connects users with trusted tiffin providers, mess owners, and home kitchens, giving vendors increased visibility, customer reach, and financial stability. Our long-term vision is to digitally transform the tiffin industry, expand across India's student and professional hubs, and uplift small-scale food businesses.

⸻

The Problem We Solve

For Students & Working Professionals:
	1.	Lack of Flexibility – Traditional tiffin services require users to commit to a single vendor for a month, leading to dissatisfaction if food quality declines.
	2.	Monotony of Meals – Eating from the same mess daily results in a lack of variety and poor meal experiences.
	3.	Limited Choices & Transparency – Finding hygienic, affordable, and trusted food vendors is a challenge.
	4.	No Refund or Mid-Month Switching Options – Users lose money if they want to change vendors mid-subscription.

For Vendors & Tiffin Providers:
	1.	Limited Customer Reach – Small mess owners and home kitchens struggle to attract customers due to a lack of digital presence.
	2.	Inconsistent Income – Many vendors experience unstable earnings due to seasonal fluctuations and dependency on word-of-mouth referrals.
	3.	No Tech-Enabled Operations – Managing subscriptions, payments, and feedback is manual and inefficient, reducing business potential.

⸻

For Students & Users:

✅ Flexible Monthly Subscription – Users can subscribe to lunch, dinner, or combo plans ranging from ₹1,500 to ₹2,000 per month.
✅ Vendor Switching (Gold Membership) – Users can switch vendors daily by informing one day prior, ensuring meal variety.

E,Ecologia Designs Pvt. Ltd.,ITS 1,Mr. Shubham Singh,Co-Founder,shubham@plutointero.com,"1) About Pluto Intero: Our Journey Towards Sustainable Innovation
Pluto Intero was born out of a passion for sustainability, innovation, and design thinking. As a startup founded by graduates of NIFT Gandhinagar, we saw an urgent need to transform home decor into a more eco-conscious, tech-savvy, and user-friendly experience. Our journey has been anything but easy—countless failures, relentless product development, and an unwavering commitment to making sustainability stylish and accessible.

2) The Beginning: How We Got the Idea
The idea for Pluto Intero emerged from a simple yet pressing realization—our homes are filled with products that contribute to environmental degradation, yet the market lacks aesthetic, durable, and smart alternatives made from recycled materials. We wanted to change that. Our goal was to create a range of home decor products that are not only sustainable but also modern, tech-integrated, and easy to use.

We began experimenting with recycled plastic as our primary material, setting out to prove that waste could be repurposed into premium, high-quality products. This decision, however, came with its own set of challenges. Unlike traditional materials, recycled plastic has inconsistencies—non-standard thickness, color variations, perforation difficulties, and durability concerns. We failed many times in the early stages, but each failure pushed us to innovate further.

3) Milestones & Achievements
Despite the hurdles, our dedication has brought us incredible recognition and opportunities. Over the past two years, we have had the privilege of showcasing our products at several prestigious platforms, including:
i) Milano Design Week in Italy – Representing sustainable Indian innovation on a global stage.
ii) Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur – Engaging with the local community and artisans.
iii) MSME Expo, Kota – Introducing our products to industry stakeholders.
iv) Events in Ahmedabad & Udaipur – Strengthening our brand presence and customer interactions.

Beyond exhibitions, our efforts have also been recognized through funding and grants. 
One of our biggest moments came in December 2024, when we had the honor of showcasing our innovation to the Hon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Rising Rajasthan in Jaipur. This was a validation of our vision and a reminder of the responsibility we hold in shaping the future of sustainable design.

4) What Makes Pluto Intero Different?
We stand apart in the home decor space because we are not just another brand—we are building an ecosystem. Our approach integrates:
i) Sustainability – Using 100% recycled plastic and expanding into agri-waste, glass waste, and construction & demolition waste.
ii) Tech-Enabled Features – Developing smart, touch-enabled products that enhance convenience and usability.
iii) Design Thinking at the Core – Every product is designed with circular economy principles, ensuring minimal waste and maximum functionality.
iv) Hassle-Free Experience – Our products are easy to install, requiring no drilling, and are designed to be flat-pack for seamless assembly.

5) Overcoming Challenges in Product Development
Creating home decor products exclusively from recycled plastic has been an uphill battle. Unlike conventional materials, recycled plastic is unpredictable—it varies in thickness, color consistency, and durability. Designing with such constraints required rigorous testing and innovation.
i) Perforations & Holes – Getting the right structure while maintaining strength was a major challenge.
ii) Non-Standard Thickness – Variability in material composition made consistency difficult.
iii) Coloring Issues – Unlike virgin plastic, recycled plastic has inherent shades, making uniformity tricky.

Despite these challenges, we persisted. Our team spent months experimenting, refining, and re-engineering designs until we created durable, functional, and visually appealing products.

6) Our Vision for the Future
Pluto Intero is not just about creating decor; it's about reshaping the industry with purposeful, tech-enabled, and sustainable products. We envision a future where homes are not only beautiful but also environmentally responsible and seamlessly smart.

In the next phase, we plan to:
i) Expand material innovation – Incorporate agri-waste, glass waste, and construction waste into new product lines.
ii) Scale up e-commerce – Strengthen our online presence through our Shopify website and Amazon listings.
iii) Enhance technology integration – Introduce advanced features in home decor, making sustainable products more interactive and user-friendly.
iv) Grow our impact – Build a community of conscious consumers who prioritize sustainability without compromising on aesthetics or convenience.

7) Why Are We Doing This?
Because home decor shouldn't come at the cost of the planet. Because sustainability should be cool, effortless, and a part of everyday life. Because we believe that technology and responsibility can create a better future!",2

Why now? Document data extraction technologies, which we technically call Optical Character Recognition (OCR), have traditionally been used to process structured documents. For unstructured and noisy documents, companies typically resort to manual data entry, which is costly, time consuming, error-prone and is susceptible to data security breach. We are transforming this landscape by not only automating the data extraction from various categories of unstructured and noisy documents, but by holistically enabling needed analysis and call to action for automated business processing or decisioning. 

What we offer? Our cutting-edge solution ‘DocEye', provides unified capability to contextually extract and process all data formats viz. scanned printed and handwritten documents, images and emails etc. DocEye, with its specialised capabilities around unstructured and noisy documents, helps automate document driven operations by removing manual intervention.

How are we Unique? One set of competition is from OCR algorithm leaders e.g., Google Vision, Amazon Text Extract, Abbyy etc. They offer generalised SaaS based offerings and the other set of competition is from solutions which are customized for use cases e.g., Daloopa, Vidado, DocSumo etc. Like the first set of solutions, Eigenlytics has its own proprietary algorithm, but with its unique approach-led design, we will be in a much better position to fit a broader spectrum of business use cases, without repetitive effort. In addition, Eigenlytics is better suited to leverage economies of scale than the second category of competition because of its wider use case fitment.",3

After conversion your vehicle will run in Electric mode as well as in Petrol mode.  As Petrol price, Air and Sound Pollution are rising so 90% vehicle should be run on Electric mode and 10% on Petrol mode that too only as an Emergency Backup. So that you wont stop in between because of Battery drain out and wait 4hr for charging the battery at the charging stations. You can also swap discharged batteries by charged batteries.",3

1. Drinking (Potable Water)
2. Production of Food & Beverages, Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals
3. In Boilers to generate hot water or steam for industries
4. As Ultrapure water in manufacturing process of electronics & semiconductors.

Wastewater / Sewage / Effluent Treatment Solutions

Wastewater is water that has been used and contaminated and includes both domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater. Due to environmental concerns and regulatory restrictions, wastewater is not suitable for discharge into public sewers or the environment such as rivers, lakes and oceans unless it has first undergone treatment to remove certain pollutants.

Environmental regulations typically stipulate the standards to which wastewater must be treated before it is permitted to be discharged into the environment. The main pollutants in sewage and industrial wastewater include dissolved and undissolved organic and inorganic materials, suspended solids, complex chemicals and heavy metals.

Once the pollutants in the wastewater are identified, a combination of some or all of the following technologies is used:

Physical removal methods are with the use of screening, sedimentation, clarification, membrane separation to remove suspended solids;

Chemical treatment methods are with the use of various chemical to breakdown pollutants through chemical reaction, disinfection, pH adjustment and precipitation (coagulation and flocculation); and

Biological treatment methods are with the use of different micro-organisms, mostly bacteria to breakdown and remove organic wastewater contents, ammonium and nitrate contaminants such as through the activated sludge process. We can provide, Extended Aeration, SBR, MBBR and MBR processes for the reduction of Organics i.e BOD & COD:

Desalination Water Solutions
Water desalination processes separate dissolved salts and other minerals from water. Feedwater sources may include brackish, seawater, wells, surface (rivers and streams), wastewater, and industrial feed and process waters. Membrane separation requires driving forces including pressure (applied and vapor), electric potential, and concentration to overcome natural osmotic pressures and effectively force water through membrane processes. As such, the technology is energy intensive and research is continually evolving to improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption.

Zero Liquid Discharge System
Zero-liquid discharge (ZLD) is a water treatment process in which all wastewater is purified and recycled; therefore, leaving zero discharge at the end of the treatment cycle. Zero liquid discharge is an advanced wastewater treatment method that includes ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, evaporation & crystallization.

Zero liquid discharge can be defined broadly as a process for maximum recovery of water from a waste water source that would otherwise be discharged. This water is beneficially reused in the industry to reduce the requirement of fresh water.

Zero liquid discharge can be achieved in various ways. There is no “one size fits all” solution, as the optimal system design is site specific. The waste water composition, various streams to be treated, site specific operating costs, foot print availability and other factors are determining factors for an optimal design.",5

E,Espouse Capital Private Limited,"1602 Morya Grand, Opp. Infinity Mall, Off Veera Desai Ind Est Road",Mr. Prasad Nediyakalayil,CFO,prasad@esopdhan.com,"Espouse Capital Pvt Ltd (brand name ESOPPDHAN), a registered NBFC engaged in providing loan to employees of matured starups to exercise ESOPs. At ESOPPDHAN, we are revolutionizing the way employees of unlisted companies unlock the true value of their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs). Many employees hesitate to exercise their ESOPs due to the significant upfront financial burden, particularly the substantial tax obligation at the time of exercise. As a result, valuable stock options often remain unutilized, depriving employees of potential wealth creation opportunities.

Our mission is to bridge this gap by offering a tailored ESOP funding solution that empowers employees to exercise their stock options without financial strain. By securing a loan from ESOPPDHAN, employees can leverage their ESOPs at an optimal time, particularly when the Fair Market Value (FMV) of their company's shares is at a lower level, allowing them to maximize potential future gains. This creates a tax arbitrage opportunity that can significantly enhance long-term wealth generation.

ESOPPDHAN's funding model is uniquely designed to be employee-friendly, ensuring that financial risk is minimized while flexibility is maximized. Our loan structure includes the following key benefits:

No EMI payments: The loan is repayable only upon a liquidity event, such as an IPO or secondary sale.

No personal guarantee or additional collateral: Employees are not required to pledge personal assets to secure the loan.

Non-recourse loan: Repayment is linked solely to the value of the underlying shares, mitigating personal financial risk.

By providing a seamless and risk-mitigated pathway to ESOP exercise, ESOPPDHAN empowers employees to take control of their financial future, participate in their company's growth, and unlock wealth-building opportunities with confidence. Join us in redefining ESOP funding and making equity ownership a reality for all employees.",5

E,Evolver Agro,12/3A Syed Nagar near Green Garden,Mr. Imran Ali,Founder,imran.ali.iifm@gmail.com,"The brand named “Turanta” which is a 
brain child of Evolver Agro, a revolutionary company aiming to bridge the gap between garlic farmers and global 
kitchens with the mission of empowering farmers by ensuring fair prices for their produce while providing consumers 
with high-quality, convenient garlic products. It proposes a comprehensive approach to address the challenges faced 
by both garlic farmers and consumers, offering a solution that benefits all stakeholders.

Genesis-: Turanta recognizes the significant disparity between the value received by farmers and the demand for quality garlic 
products by consumers. On the supply side, small-scale garlic farmers in India, particularly in the state of Uttar Pradesh, 
face multiple challenges. They lack access to Minimum Support Price (MSP) guarantees, have limited value-addition 
opportunities, and rely heavily on local traders and mandis for selling their produce. This results in an unfair pricing 
system, where farmers receive significantly less than the true value of their labor and produce. On the consumption 
side, consumers grapple with inconsistent quality, time-consuming peeling processes, limited shelf life, and fluctuating 
prices.

Turanta's Vision: A Win-Win Solution
Direct Procurement-:  Evolver Agro will implement a direct procurement model through contract farming, collection 
centers, and mobile procurement units. This will eliminate middlemen and ensure farmers receive a fair price for their 
produce. 
Value Addition-: Turanta will offer a wide range of garlic-based products, including peeled garlic, dehydrated garlic 
(minced, chopped, granulated, and powdered), garlic paste, garlic oil, garlic powder, garlic pickle, garlic butter, and 
garlic in brine. This value addition will enhance the marketability of garlic and increase its shelf life, reducing food 
waste.",6

F,Fery Rides,"2nd Floor, Gateway B Building, National Highway-08, 67th Milestone",Mr. Ajay Kumar,Founder & CEO,ajay@feryrides.com,"Fery is India's first women-centric, electric two-wheeler ride-hailing platform — built to provide safe, reliable, and eco-friendly mobility for women, by women. Our mission is rooted in solving two pressing urban challenges: women's safety in public transport and the lack of economic opportunities for women in the mobility sector.

At Fery, we are not just another ride-hailing app. We are a social innovation, blending gender empowerment, clean energy, and technology to transform how women travel and work in Indian cities.

The Problem We're Solving
Urban India has a mobility crisis — especially for women. Public transport is overcrowded, unsafe, and largely male-dominated. Women are forced to compromise on dignity and safety just to get from one place to another. Simultaneously, millions of women from underserved communities seek dignified employment but are held back by societal norms, lack of training, or financial support.

Our Solution
Fery operates an all-electric fleet of two-wheelers, driven exclusively by women, called our Sister Partners. The platform provides women travelers with anxiety-free mobility while generating dignified income opportunities for women drivers.

Women Riders Only: We onboard and train women from diverse backgrounds to become professional drivers.

Women Passengers Only: Our app serves only female customers, ensuring comfort and psychological safety.

Electric Vehicles: We are committed to climate action through a 100% EV fleet, reducing our carbon footprint with every ride.

Tech-Driven Platform: Our mobile app features SOS alerts, facial recognition, no-surge pricing, zero-cancellation, geofencing, and seamless digital payments — all designed with women's needs in mind.

Our Impact So Far
🚀 Launched in April 2023, Fery has already made remarkable strides:

✅ 50,000+ rides completed
✅ 1,25,000+ ride requests received
✅ 35,000+ registered users
✅ 250+ women trained
✅ 3,50,000+ EV kilometers driven
✅ 30+ tonnes of CO₂ saved
✅ 1,50,000+ lives impacted (directly & indirectly)

We've also been honored with recognitions such as:
🏆 HDFC Parivartan Grant Winner
🏆 Shoonya Champion for Inclusion & Empowerment by NITI Aayog
🏆 Top 16 City Champions by IIM Calcutta & Josh Talks

Why Fery is Unique
✅ Exclusively for Women – Both riders and drivers
✅ Built Around Safety – Facial recognition, GPS tracking, SOS features
✅ Focused on Empowerment – Livelihood + dignity + digital literacy + training
✅ 100% Electric – Green kilometers, zero emissions

We bridge the gap between fresher/experienced professionals in healthcare sector and top employers through targeted recruitment tools and services.

It addresses the significant gap in the market where generic job portals fail to provide targeted, quality matches for jobs in the healthcare sector. 
Problem: Generic job portals fail healthcare recruiters due to irrelevant applications, lack of industry-specific data, and poor pre-screening. Similarly candidates looking for jobs get irrelevant job influx leading to disappointment. 

Employer's dilemma with generic job portals:
•	Employer in healthcare sector posts a job that competes with other sector job posts on the key words. For example: A job posted for “Area Manager” in a healthcare sector company gets numerous candidates from irrelevant industries like Auto-mobiles, BFSI, FMCG and so on. 
•	Employer gets influx of candidates whereas more than 90% is from different sector and thus irrelevant
•	HR managers waste time to scrutinise from huge database and end up with frustration.
•	The obvious outcome is that it results into condition of URGENCY leading to wrong hire and then very soon in couple of months the vicious cycle repeats.

Candidate's struggle with generic job portals:
•	Gets irrelevant jobs influx just on the basis of key words
•	To get relevant jobs have to search from job pool with relevant keywords that include company name, industry etc., which most the candidates are not aware of.
•	Candidate's job applications are competing with other industry candidates thus making their chances bleak. 

Solution: A COMPREHENSIVE healthcare-specific job portal that streamlines recruitment with Auto-matching algorithm and pre-screening of candidates with Assessment Test and AI tools like Ai Interview; covering all industries in healthcare sector and all departments.

GetMedJob USPs:
1)	A comprehensive online recruitment platform for healthcare sector: 
There are multiple recruitment platforms available. However, none (except Naukri, FoundIT and Indeed) are catering to all industries in healthcare covering all department in each of these industries.
Most of other platforms are either focused on Hospital Jobs that too some specific jobs like Doctors or Nurses or few of healthcare sector industries catering to limited departments. 
2)	Single platform for Students, Freshers and Experienced professionals
3)	Assessment test for pre-screening of candidates
4)	Resume Builder for ATS friendly resume. Customised according to experience
5)	Campus-2-Corporate: A unique platform where Corporate, University/Institute and Students can look for Internship and Campus Placements.
6)	Intelligent algorithm to auto-match quality candidates with relevant jobs and vice-versa. Thus resulting in 2x faster and better hiring. 
7)	Direct chat module for Employer and Candidate
8)	Multilingual software English, Hindi, French, Russian, Spanish for global coverage. 
9)	Ai Interviewer (to be launched): Online ai interview of candidates to give flexibility to HR and Candidate to take interview any time as per convenience. Take multiple interviews at same time. Detailed quality assessment score of the candidate's interview. Eliminates all interview rounds and leaving just the final negotiation round for the HR manager.",4

In a little over 2 years, we have crafted 3 games in this genre.
""Mili Match"", our 1st game takes our players through the journey of Mili, a wedding planner who plans various Indian weddings. From Haldi, Sangeet and Baaraat in parts of northern India to Oonjal, Mangalsnanam and Kalyanam in the south, she covers the landscape and brings alive the rich Indian cultural traditions

""Rani's Case Files"" is a crime themed puzzle match-3 game where Rani is tasked to solve the most complex crime mysteries from Prathamnagar in India. 

Our latest game, ""Travel Match India"" , gives our players the experience of travelling through the Indian landscape, discovering not just the well known but also the hitherto undiscovered

All of the above games are available to download for FREE on both Google Playstore and Apple Appstore!

Krishnendu Mukherjee, Rahul DS and Rahul Daga, the founders at Giga Fun have spent 25+ years combined at various gaming studios, creating and operating games for India and the world.

Scotch, Bourbon or Japanese are iconic whiskey categories eternally connected to the regions they are made in, to their origins. But origins are not just a point on a map – they also bottle the emotions of the people, the land, and the cultures tied to it.

This made us wonder – if India has the largest whiskey market in the world (yes, it's true!), then why is it still dominated by foreign players? Why is there no noteworthy “Indian” whiskey category?

Started by Shivam Ginglani, a first-generation whiskey entrepreneur, Woodsmen is an attempt at breaking the shackles around the Indian whiskey industry, building an entirely new category of “Himalayan whiskey” with authentic roots.

As a core element, water makes the most difference to whiskey, simply because any whiskey is nearly 60% water.

Luckily, India has the greatest mountains in the world, the Himalayas, which bring all the magic to our whiskey – this is the Woodsmen difference. Together with the local Himachali community, we've tried to bring together the flavors, the spirit, and the beauty of the Himalayas in our bottle.

G,GPSNK Pvt. Ltd,B-78,Mr. Arjun Davar,Director,arjundavar@gmail.com,"Our story began on the winding streets of distant cities, where every corner held a new taste to discover. As we journeyed across the globe, we found ourselves irresistibly drawn to the vibrant world of cocktail bars. These were not mere places to grab a drink, but sanctuaries of art and flavor. Each cocktail was a masterpiece, a harmonious blend of exotic ingredients, crafted with passion and precision. The air was thick with tantalizing aromas, the buzz of laughter, and the clinking of glasses—a celebration of life's finer pleasures. These moments of delight sparked a desire to share these mesmerizing experiences with friends and family back home.

Upon returning to India, something was amiss. The cocktails lacked the depth we had come to adore, and those that met the mark were at upscale venues, priced beyond the reach of regular enjoyment. More poignantly, we noticed a silent majority—those who embraced a non-alcoholic lifestyle were left on the sidelines with seriously unimaginative options. Time and again, they were handed a coke, a simple juice, or at best, a virgin mojito. Where was the excitement, innovation, and respect for their palates, we wondered.

Born from a passion for mixology and a commitment to inclusivity, Dranks offers well-crafted, flavour-packed drinks accessible to all and aims to revolutionize the beverage landscape.

It's about inclusion, enjoyment, and elevating the current standards.

We're not about luxury for luxury's sake; we're about genuine quality and adding a touch of class to every pour.

Introduction

In an era of constantly evolving work dynamics, teams need more than just another messaging platform. Surge is the next-generation, AI-powered collaboration platform meticulously crafted to redefine the way teams connect, collaborate, and execute work. Unlike conventional platforms, Surge blends advanced real-time team visualization with agentic AI, creating a seamless environment where humans and intelligent agents collaborate side by side.

The Core Vision Behind Surge

At its core, Surge is not merely a tool—it's a fundamental transformation of workplace interaction. Inspired by the philosophy that productivity and efficiency thrive in environments with zero friction, Surge seeks to eliminate the barriers that traditional communication tools inadvertently create. The ultimate goal is simple yet revolutionary: empower teams to move at the speed of thought and execution.

The Problem with Traditional Collaboration

Today's collaboration tools like Slack, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams have revolutionized the way we communicate, yet significant challenges remain:

Fragmented Workflows: Constant switching between messaging apps, calendars, video conferencing platforms, and project management tools disrupts focus and diminishes productivity.

Inefficient Scheduling: Arranging meetings and coordinating availability consumes significant time and often delays critical decision-making.

Limited Visibility: Traditional platforms provide minimal context beyond an online or offline status. Teams are left guessing about real-time engagement, collaboration patterns, and productivity bottlenecks.

Passive AI Integration: Existing AI capabilities remain largely passive—assisting minimally without actively participating in and enhancing the workflow.

Surge is specifically engineered to overcome these limitations and set a new standard for collaboration.

Real-Time Team Visualization: Beyond the Busy Status

Surge introduces a groundbreaking visualization feature that revolutionizes the concept of presence and availability:

Beyond ""Busy"" or ""Available"": Surge users see exactly who their teammates are interacting with and in what context. This rich visibility provides intuitive insights, enabling smarter and faster interactions.

Instant ""Drop-In"" Conversations: Traditional scheduling is replaced by immediate, intuitive actions. Users can seamlessly ""drop in"" to active conversations or collaboration sessions, drastically reducing response times and improving decision velocity.

Enhanced Collaboration Dynamics: By seeing ongoing team interactions, Surge ensures every team member knows precisely when and how to engage effectively.

This powerful visualization not only reduces the friction associated with communication but cultivates an environment of continuous, productive collaboration.

Agentic AI: Active Participation, Not Passive Assistance

Surge's distinct competitive advantage lies in its robust integration of agentic AI. Unlike traditional AI features limited to basic chatbots, Surge embeds intelligent agents deeply into daily workflows, actively driving productivity:

AI-Powered Transcripts: Surge automatically captures, transcribes, and summarizes meetings, whether conducted within the platform, on third-party services like Google Meet and Zoom, or even offline. These comprehensive meeting notes become readily accessible and actionable.

AI Co-Pilot: Serving as an intelligent virtual assistant, the Surge co-pilot provides instant access to organizational knowledge. Users can query complex data sets, company policies, past meeting summaries, and more, receiving precise, contextually relevant answers instantly.

Real-Time Screen Collaboration: Surge's AI agents can interact directly with shared screens during meetings. Users simply point their cursor to any element on-screen, prompting the AI to provide immediate explanations, suggestions, or actions. This dynamic interaction dramatically enhances clarity and accelerates problem-solving.

Voice and Chat Interaction: Users can seamlessly communicate with their AI agents via both voice and text. The conversational capabilities of these agents are highly intuitive, reducing the cognitive load and making interactions feel natural and human-like.

Proactive Task Management: Surge's personal agents actively participate in meetings, listen to conversations, and autonomously identify and execute follow-up tasks. These agents send proactive notifications, reminders, and can even initiate delegated actions based on the meeting context.

Specialized Task Delegation: In future iterations, Surge will introduce specialized AI agents designed to handle specific organizational tasks—whether administrative, analytical, or creative—further streamlining operational efficiency.

Unlike traditional property portals that only provide basic listing details, HuntVastuHomes offers data-driven Vastu insights using a proprietary algorithm developed by Dr. Smita Narang, a globally recognised Vastu expert with over two decades of experience.

This innovation solves a very real problem. While 93% of Indian homebuyers prefer Vastu-compliant homes, there is no existing platform that helps them filter or evaluate properties based on Vastu principles. Instead, buyers rely on expensive, subjective Vastu consultants or guesswork - often leading to confusion and lack of trust. HuntVastuHomes eliminates this uncertainty by providing automated Vastu ratings for each property, evaluating critical parameters like entrance direction, room placement, kitchen and toilet location, cuts, extensions, and more.

The higher the Vastu rating, the better the compliance - making it easy for users to compare and choose homes aligned with their preferences and beliefs.

We follow a multi-revenue model catering to both individual buyers (B2C) and real estate professionals (B2B):
• Buyers can view Vastu ratings for listed units through packages priced at ₹599 per unit, and ₹2499 for 5 units.
• Builders and brokers can purchase B2B packages starting from ₹21,000, allowing them to analyse up to 50 units and attract Vastu-conscious buyers.
• Users can also upload floor plans of unlisted properties for custom Vastu checks at ₹1999 per unit.
• Future monetisation streams include Vastu remedy suggestions, premium listing services, and a property sale-purchase marketplace.

Currently, the platform hosts over 690 residential projects across 7 cities. Since our beta launch in April 2024 with just 16 users, we have grown organically to 660+ registered users as of mid March 2025, with increasing platform activity and paid conversions.

HuntVastuHomes is built to be highly scalable, thanks to our AI-powered, automated Vastu analysis engine. Our vision is to grow into a comprehensive real estate ecosystem, enabling property discovery, shortlisting, and eventually direct buying and selling, all under one roof - with Vastu compliance at the core.

Our conservative market estimate based on online property seekers places our:
• TAM at 9.76 crore users (by 2030),
• SAM at 2.93 crore users, and
• SOM at 0.06 crore users,
with HuntVastuHomes targeting a minimum 2% market share. These are modest projections - we expect demand to rise significantly as awareness spreads.

• Raj Kumar Narang, Co-Founder & CEO, is a tech entrepreneur with 26+ years of experience, previously part of IndiaMART and founder of JustOrbit.com.
• Dr. Smita Narang, Co-Founder & Vastu Expert, holds a PhD in Vastu Shastra and is the author of the book “WebVastu.” She has served thousands of clients globally.

I,IC Fitness Club Education Private Limited,"B-5 Patel Garden Dwarka Mor, Delhi 110078",Mr. Deepak Bhardwaj,Director,dbhardwaj27199@gmail.com,"IC Fitness Club: Transforming the Fitness Industry Through Education & Innovation
Introduction
IC Fitness Club is a leading fitness education and training platform in India, committed to raising industry standards by providing high-quality education and professional fitness training. Founded by Deepak Bhardwaj, a former Mr. Delhi bodybuilder and experienced personal trainer, the platform focuses on bridging the gap between clients and educated personal trainers.

Vision & Mission
The Indian fitness industry struggles with two significant challenges:

Unqualified Trainers: Many trainers lack formal education in exercise science and human anatomy, leading to incorrect training methods and injuries such as golfer's elbow, tennis elbow, shoulder impingement, and slipped discs.

Finding the Right Trainer: Clients often struggle to find personal trainers who have the knowledge and expertise to design effective, personalized workout programs.

IC Fitness Club is on a mission to solve these challenges by offering structured education and professional certifications that create a network of well-trained, science-backed fitness professionals.

Fitness Science Academy: Empowering Trainers with Knowledge
Since 2021, IC Fitness Club has successfully operated its Fitness Science Academy in Dwarka Mor, Delhi, which provides world-class training in:

📌 Certified Personal Trainer (CPT) Course – Focuses on human anatomy, biomechanics, exercise science, strength training, and client assessment.
📌 Sports Nutrition Certification – Covers macronutrients, micronutrients, diet planning, and performance nutrition for athletes and fitness enthusiasts.
📌 Injury Prevention & Rehabilitation – Helps trainers and clients understand common gym injuries, corrective exercises, and recovery techniques.

These certifications equip trainers with scientific knowledge to help clients achieve results safely and effectively.

Gymploy.com: India's First Fitness Recruitment Platform
IC Fitness Club launched Gymploy.com, India's first dedicated fitness recruitment platform, to connect personal trainers with gym organizations across the country.

- Trainers – Certified professionals can find job opportunities in reputed gyms.
- Gym Owners – Can hire qualified trainers with verified credentials.

This initiative ensures higher industry standards by helping gyms recruit educated professionals rather than untrained individuals.

Why IC Fitness Club Stands Out?
Unlike many fitness startups that rely on marketing gimmicks, IC Fitness Club is built on real-world experience and scientific knowledge. Deepak Bhardwaj and his team personally test all fitness methodologies before teaching them to others.

Key Differentiators:
✔ Science-Backed Training: Unlike many unqualified trainers, IC Fitness Club follows evidence-based principles in fitness and nutrition.
✔ Industry Experts as Trainers: Every instructor at IC Fitness Club has years of hands-on experience in personal training, bodybuilding, and sports nutrition.
✔ Recruitment Support for Trainers: Gymploy.com ensures that qualified trainers get hired in top fitness organizations.

By focusing on education, practical training, and recruitment, IC Fitness Club is building a professional ecosystem for the Indian fitness industry.",1

We strive to create social impact through job creation, fair wages, and skill development while building a profitable and sustainable business.
Our mission is to empower our artisans by taking our brand to a global stage. To preserve and innovate the art of Chikankari by creating exquisite, handcrafted lifestyle products that blend tradition with contemporary elegance. 
Despite its rich heritage, Chikankari embroidery remains largely limited to apparel, with artisans often facing low wages, inconsistent demand, and lack of global market access. Additionally, the home textile industry is dominated by mass-produced, machine-made products, leaving little space for authentic, artisanal alternatives.
Inara operates in both B2B and B2C segments, allowing for diversified revenue streams. B2B partnerships with premium retailers and direct-to-consumer channels provide financial stability and room for expansion. The scalability of this model makes it adaptable to multiple market segments globally.
Inara's business model is an attractive investment opportunity for several reasons:

Social Impact & Revenue Model:
With a focus on artisanal craftsmanship, sustainability, and women's empowerment, Inara appeals to the growing market of conscious consumers. Investors focused on social impact will find this dual mission of profit and positive change appealing.

Rising Demand for Sustainable Luxury:
The market for luxury sustainable products is growing. Inara is well-positioned to meet this demand with Chikankari-based home textiles. Our blend of heritage craftsmanship and modern design caters to consumers seeking ethically produced luxury goods, opening global markets.

Diverse Revenue Streams:
Inara operates in both B2B and B2C segments, offering diverse revenue streams that ensure financial stability and flexibility as we scale.

Proven Impact & Market Validation:
With B2B partnerships and a growing artisan base, Inara has proven its concept. This positions us as a low-risk, high-reward investment with potential for both social and financial returns.
Inara's intent is to address the economic, environmental, and social challenges faced by artisans, especially women in rural India, while meeting the growing demand for premium, sustainable, and ethically crafted lifestyle products. Although we are in the early stages of implementing these solutions, our goal is to build a scalable, sustainable model that empowers artisans and preserves cultural heritage.

1. Empowering Artisans with Fair Compensation and Training
Inara aims to provide consistent work opportunities to artisans, ensuring fair wages for their craftsmanship. While we are expanding our artisan base, our long-term goal is to create a direct, transparent supply chain that ensures artisans receive equitable pay. As we grow, we plan to provide training on modern design techniques and quality control to enhance their global competitiveness.

2. Sustainable & Eco-Friendly Production Processes
Currently, we focus on using Azo-free dyes and chemical-free washing techniques to ensure our products are safe for artisans and consumers. Our future goal is to expand our eco-conscious production practices, such as reducing energy use and waste. We plan to scale our handmade processes to reduce our carbon footprint and champion slow fashion, producing durable, timeless pieces.

3. Social Empowerment & Women's Inclusion
Inara currently employs 80% female artisans, many of whom work from home. We aim to expand work-from-home opportunities to provide financial independence for rural women. Additionally, we will help artisans open bank accounts, develop financial literacy, and access healthcare to promote long-term financial inclusion and well-being.

4. Expanding Market Access and Creating Impactful Partnerships
We are currently introducing Chikankari to the premium home textile market through B2B partnerships. As we scale, we intend to expand these partnerships and establish relationships with global retailers and premium brands, providing artisans with access to new, high-value markets.
Inara's vision is to grow into a brand that not only creates beautiful products but also drives economic, social, and environmental impact. We are committed to gradually implementing impactful changes, ensuring that as we grow, we positively transform the lives of our artisans and communities.",2

As a brand dedicated to ""Authentic, Indian, Handmade"" creations, it curates and offers over 7,000 unique pieces—each crafted under its own label, directly from India's artisan clusters. From the fine muslin and jamdani sarees of Santipur and Phulia to the vibrant kantha, banjara, and appliqué embroideries of Barmer, every item is a testament to India's timeless artistry.  

Born from a mission to preserve vanishing crafts, IndieHaat addresses a critical gap: artisans in rural clusters like Maheshwari, Mangalagiri, and Kutch faced limited access to markets, while urban consumers yearned for genuine, handcrafted products. The brand's decentralized network of 60+ artisan hubs ensures that handloom weavers, embroiderers, and craftsmen collaborate directly with IndieHaat. Weekly collections, refreshed with 2–3 new launches, reach customers across India in 1–7 days—90% of orders meet this timeline.  

For artisans, IndieHaat is a lifeline. Santipur's muslin weavers, renowned for their translucent fabrics, now craft sarees that grace modern wardrobes. Phulia's jamdani artisans, once struggling with erratic demand, create intricate patterns that blend tradition with contemporary aesthetics. In Barmer, women skilled in banjara and appliqué embroidery stitch vibrant home decor, their work now celebrated in urban homes. The brand's fair credit terms (7–25 days) and elimination of middlemen ensure artisans earn sustainably—like Kutch's embroiderers reviving mirror work or Chanderi's weavers producing lightweight silks that echo royal heritage.  

Shoppers discover exclusivity with every purchase. A Delhi homemaker adorns her dining table with Barmer's appliqué table runners; a Kolkata bride chooses a Phulia jamdani saree, knowing no two pieces are alike. IndieHaat's “no mass production” ethos ensures uniqueness, while customization options—like adjusting a Mangalagiri cotton saree's border—add personal flair. Quality assurance, buyer insurance, and hassle-free returns build trust, reflected in a 35% repeat customer rate and steady growth, with FY24 revenue crossing ₹4.2 crore and a 70% YoY increase.  

Operational agility drives this success. An asset-light, no-inventory model allows the brand to scale swiftly—launching new collections or expanding to new regions without logistical bottlenecks.

Beyond commerce, IndieHaat weaves social impact. When a Maheshwari weaver's saree becomes a corporate gifting favorite or a Santipur muslin dupatta travels to international shores, it revitalizes communities. The brand's focus on natural fibers—cotton, silk, wool—aligns with sustainable living, while empowering artisans to innovate. A Mangalagiri craftsman experiments with indigo dyes; a Kutch artisan blends traditional embroidery with modern silhouettes.  

Looking ahead, IndieHaat envisions a future where handmade is not a rarity but a choice. Plans to introduce luxury khadi and explore global markets aim to elevate Indian crafts, but the heart remains rooted in empowerment. Every purchase sustains a craft, every design honors hands that weave stories.  

IndieHaat is more than a brand—it's a bridge between heritage and today, where the phrase ""Kyunki Haath Ka Kam Janchta Hai"" comes alive. Explore this world at indiehaat.com, where tradition is timeless, and every thread carries a legacy.",2

By leveraging a B->B->C business model, Instaclaus connects companies with their workforce, enabling employees to apply for loans in a simple and secure manner. This innovative approach not only facilitates quick access to funds but also enhances employee satisfaction and retention.

Overview of Instaclaus
Instaclaus operates as a payroll financing platform, collaborating with corporate employers to provide salary advances exclusively to their employees. This model eliminates the traditional complexities associated with loan applications, making it easier for employees to manage unexpected financial needs.

Key Features of Instaclaus
Zero Cost and Liability for Employers: The platform incurs no costs or liabilities for the employer, as the responsibility for repayment lies solely with the employee.

Flexible Loan Terms: Employees can apply for loans up to 70% of their monthly in-hand salary, with repayment options available in EMIs of 3, 6, 9, or 12 months at an attractive interest rate of 20% per annum.

No Impact on Credit Scores: Interest rates are unaffected by the employee's credit score, ensuring fair access to loans regardless of individual credit histories.

Minimal Documentation: The application process requires minimal paperwork, further simplifying access to funds.

Automated Repayment Process: Loan repayments are automatically deducted from employee salaries, reducing administrative burdens on HR departments.

Enhanced Employee Satisfaction: By providing quick and easy access to funds, Instaclaus improves overall employee financial well-being and satisfaction.

How Instaclaus Works
Step-by-Step Process
Company Collaboration: Instaclaus partners with companies to offer salary advance benefits to their employees.

Employee Onboarding: Employers provide necessary employee details in a specified format to create profiles/accounts on the platform.

Loan Application: Employees log into the Instaclaus app using mobile number verification and submit loan requests within their salary limit.

Employer Approval: All loan requests must be approved by the employer before proceeding with disbursement.

Loan Disbursement: Upon approval, the loan amount is disbursed directly into the employee's salary account by Oriental Finstocks Services Pvt. Ltd., the partnering NBFC.

Repayment Management: Repayments are structured in EMIs and deducted from salaries on payday. Employers remit these amounts back to Instaclaus.

Monitoring and Compliance: Employers have access to a dashboard for tracking employee loan activity and ensuring compliance with repayment terms.

Additional Considerations
Late Payment Penalties: Employers incur daily penalties for delayed remittance of EMI payments beyond a 24-hour grace period post-salary disbursement.

Employee Termination Protocols: Employers must ensure that all outstanding dues are settled before an employee exits the company.

Pro Rata Interest Calculation: Interest is calculated on a day-to-day basis, ensuring that employees only pay for the days they utilize the loan.

Benefits for Employees
Instaclaus provides numerous advantages for employees seeking financial assistance:

Quick Access to Funds: Employees can bypass lengthy application processes and gain immediate access to needed funds.

Flexible Repayment Options: With various EMI plans available, employees can choose what best fits their financial situation.

Automatic Deductions: Simplified repayment through salary deductions helps employees manage their finances without additional stress.

Increased Credit Limits: Timely repayments can lead to increased credit limits for future loans, promoting financial growth.

Benefits for Employers
Employers also stand to gain significantly from partnering with Instaclaus:

Streamlined Loan Management: The user-friendly dashboard allows employers to efficiently track loan requests and repayments without extensive HR involvement.

Reduced Administrative Burden: By automating many aspects of the loan process, HR teams can focus on more strategic initiatives rather than day-to-day loan management.

Enhanced Employee Satisfaction and Retention: Offering easy access to financial assistance can improve overall employee morale and retention rates.",4

The company is committed to redefining indoor air quality through innovation, leveraging advanced technology to create healthier living and working environments.

With a firm focus on wellness and sustainability, JLSR WELLNESS has developed URBOX, a state-of-the-art solution designed to enhance indoor oxygen levels, improving overall well-being and productivity. After successfully testing over three years to refine the product, the company is now ready for market expansion.

About URBOX
URBOX is a first-of-its-kind indoor air optimization system that increases oxygen levels in indoor spaces up to 25%, enhancing air quality and human health. Unlike conventional air purifiers, which only filter air, URBOX actively optimizes oxygen levels while simultaneously flushing out toxic air, making it an ideal solution for homes and office spaces.

Key Features of URBOX
Oxygen Optimization: Enhances indoor oxygen levels up to 25% in ambient air.

AI, ML & IoT-Based Control: Smart automation for seamless air quality management.

Auto ON/OFF Timer: Intelligent scheduling for energy efficiency.

Self-Cleaning Mechanism: Reduces maintenance hassle with an auto-cleaning concept.

Silent Operation: Functions with pin-drop silence indoors.

Easy Installation & Maintenance: ""Fit it & forget it"" with yearly maintenance.

No Refills Required: A sleek, modern design that complements interiors without recurring refill costs.

Scalable Solution: Suitable for both existing and new homes and offices.

Why URBOX?
Modern indoor spaces are sealed environments due to air conditioners, pollution, and noise concerns. This leads to oxygen depletion, which negatively impacts health, causing fatigue, cognitive decline, poor sleep, and respiratory issues. URBOX directly addresses these problems by ensuring a continuous flow of fresh, oxygen-enriched air, leading to:

Improved cognitive function

Higher energy levels

Better sleep quality

Enhanced immune system

Reduced stress & anxiety

Improved lung & heart function

Future Vision
JLSR WELLNESS aims to establish URBOX as a global leader in indoor air quality solutions, ensuring healthier environments across homes, offices, healthcare facilities, and commercial spaces.

K,KRENG EDUCATION PVT LTD,"k1/105, Kalinga Nagar, Ghatikia,",Mr. Amiya Mishra,Founder,krengeducationpvtltd@gmail.com,"We are a pioneering STEM toy manufacturer and education provider dedicated to transforming the way children learn through play. Our innovative, screen-free DIY kits are designed to make STEM education engaging, hands-on, and accessible to all. As a leader in the industry, we go beyond traditional learning methods by integrating real-world problem-solving into our toys, fostering creativity, critical thinking, and design skills in young minds.

Our toys are carefully crafted to align with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, ensuring they complement school curriculums while promoting experiential learning. Unlike many STEM solutions that rely heavily on screens and digital interfaces, we focus on tangible, interactive experiences that enhance motor skills, logical reasoning, and cognitive development. By bridging the gap between education and entertainment, we empower both schools and parents with the tools they need to nurture the next generation of innovators.

As a STEM toy manufacturer, we are committed to high-quality, sustainable production. Our toys are made from biodegradable plastics and utilize cutting-edge additive manufacturing techniques to ensure durability and environmental responsibility. We believe that learning should be fun, immersive, and responsible, which is why our products are designed to be both educational and eco-friendly.

As a STEM education provider, we offer structured, curriculum-based learning experiences that cater to schools, educators, and homeschooling parents. Our kits are designed to be easily integrated into classroom settings, providing teachers with simple, engaging tools that require minimal training. We recognize that not all schools have access to advanced STEM labs, so we develop solutions that can be used in any learning environment, regardless of resources.

One of the key differentiators of our approach is our focus on real-world applications. While many STEM kits primarily teach coding and robotics, we expand into broader areas such as sustainable energy, smart automation, engineering principles, and hands-on physics experiments. Our products help children understand how STEM concepts apply to everyday life, inspiring them to think critically about the world around them.

We also emphasize affordability and accessibility. Many existing STEM kits are costly and subscription-based, making them out of reach for schools in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. We address this gap by offering high-quality, cost-effective solutions that ensure all children, regardless of their background, have access to innovative STEM education.

To keep students engaged, our toys incorporate gamification and interactive challenges, making learning feel like play rather than a chore. This approach not only increases retention but also encourages children to experiment, explore, and innovate with confidence.

With a strong commitment to bridging the gap between education and play, we provide STEM toys and learning solutions that inspire young minds, equip educators, and empower parents. Our mission is to create the most innovative, sustainable, and impactful STEM learning experiences, shaping a generation of thinkers, problem-solvers, and future leaders.",4

As a premium brand specializing in 100% human hair extensions and custom-made wigs, we stand at the intersection of authenticity, purpose, and beauty. Our journey is rooted in a powerful belief—that beauty should be an expression of identity, a source of confidence, and above all, a force for good.

It is a beacon for purposeful entrepreneurship, a tribute to India's rich cultural heritage, and a testament to what is possible when vision is powered by values. At a time when the beauty industry has often prioritized aesthetics over authenticity, we have taken a radically different path—one where every strand of hair tells a story, every product is a promise, and every purchase is a step toward conscious consumerism. What makes HairOriginals truly transformative is our ability to merge deep-rooted Indian traditions with cutting-edge global aspirations. From clip-ins and keratin tips to full-coverage wigs, each of our premium offerings is crafted from ethically sourced, 100% Remy human hair. These aren't just beauty accessories—they are tools of transformation for women navigating hair loss, styling diversity, or simply looking to embrace their best selves.

HairOriginals: Transforming Beauty Ethically, From the Roots India, known for its spiritual depth and ancient traditions, is also the birthplace of one of the most unique beauty rituals in the world: temple hair offerings. This sacred act, rooted in humility, faith, and gratitude, forms the very foundation of HairOriginals. In temples across the country, individuals—many of them women—donate their hair as an offering to deities, signifying a personal sacrifice or a prayer fulfilled. These donations, made without expectation of material return, represent one of the world's purest acts of devotion. At HairOriginals, we see these offerings not just as raw material, but as symbols of strength and hope. Every strand of hair we use is ethically sourced from these temple donations, handled with reverence, and processed with care. We transform them into luxurious, premium hair extensions and wigs that serve customers around the globe. Our wigs and extensions, made from 100% Remy human hair, are designed not only to enhance beauty but to restore confidence—particularly for individuals experiencing hair loss due to medical conditions or natural causes. Founded with Purpose Founded in 2019 by IIT alumnus Jitendra Sharma and co-founder Piyush Wadhwani, HairOriginals was born out of a mission to bring structure, transparency, and dignity to the fragmented hair extension industry. With a deep understanding of the market and a shared commitment to social impact, the founders identified a critical gap: although India was the global hub for the best quality human hair, most of its value was captured by foreign intermediaries. At a time when global markets exploited Indian raw material with little return to its source, HairOriginals decided to rewrite the rules—owning the value chain, ensuring fair trade, and delivering quality without compromise. The duo envisioned a brand that could stand tall among international names while remaining rooted in Indian culture and values. By building a vertically integra",4

L,LEVO.AI INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED,"PLOT NO 5, 2ND FLOOR, SURVEY NO 66 AND 67, V V C KONARK JUBILEE ENCLAVE, MADHAPUR, HYDERABAD, Hyderabad, Telangana, 500081",Ms. Namratha RK,Head of International Business Development,namratha@levo.ai,"Levo.ai is a cutting-edge API security platform designed to empower enterprises with comprehensive visibility, control, and protection over their API ecosystems. Built by developers for developers, Levo.ai addresses the complexities of modern API-driven architectures by offering a full lifecycle solution that seamlessly integrates into DevSecOps workflows. Founded in 2021 by Buchi Reddy and a team of seasoned engineering leaders with deep expertise in distributed microservices and APIs, Levo.ai emerged from their firsthand experiences tackling API sprawl, security vulnerabilities, and the challenges of maintaining secure applications in fast-paced, agile environments. The platform's mission is to simplify API security, accelerate development cycles, and proactively mitigate risks, ensuring organizations can confidently deploy secure and resilient APIs.

At its core, Levo.ai provides an automated, end-to-end approach to API observability and security testing. It tackles the pervasive issue of API sprawl—where enterprises often lose track of their APIs due to rapid development and deployment cycles—by continuously discovering, documenting, and testing every API across internal, external, and third-party systems. Unlike traditional security tools that rely on manual processes or reactive measures, Levo.ai shifts security left, embedding it into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) from design and local build stages through pre-production environments. This proactive stance helps organizations identify and remediate vulnerabilities early, reducing the attack surface and minimizing the need for costly post-production fixes or third-party pentesting services.

Levo.ai's standout capabilities include its ability to automatically generate a comprehensive API inventory without requiring code changes, leveraging both code-based and traffic-based instrumentation. This dual approach ensures unparalleled visibility, uncovering not only active APIs but also dormant ""zombie"" or ""shadow"" APIs that could pose hidden risks. The platform produces detailed OpenAPI specifications and Postman collections for every discovered API, complete with human-readable descriptions, usage guides, and changelogs powered by generative AI. This automation eliminates the documentation burden on developers, enhances API monetization potential, and ensures compliance with standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR by mapping sensitive data flows and identifying security gaps, such as endpoints with weak authentication.

Security testing is another pillar of Levo.ai's offering. The platform conducts continuous, automated testing in CI/CD pipelines, targeting vulnerabilities like those in the OWASP API Security Top 10, including Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) and Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA). Its real-time testing visibility and ability to rerun failed tests from a user-friendly dashboard maximize coverage and efficiency, reducing false positives—a common pain point in traditional testing tools. Additionally, Levo.ai supports passive security testing for policy adherence, allowing organizations to enforce custom rules tailored to their specific needs using flexible configurations in Python and YAML.

Privacy and efficiency are baked into Levo.ai's architecture. Unlike competitors that store extensive customer data, Levo retains less than 1% (only OpenAPI specs), processing most data on-premises or in self-hosted environments via its sensor and satellite system. This minimizes compliance risks and cloud costs, requiring just half a CPU core and 0.5GB RAM even at scale. The platform also integrates seamlessly with existing tools like AWS API Gateway, Cloudflare, and various CI/CD systems, making adoption straightforward for engineering and security teams.

Levo.ai's impact is evident in its partnerships with companies like Insurance information bureau of India, AngelOne, Zluri, and leading fintech firms, where it has reduced attack surfaces, accelerated deployment speeds, and enhanced API visibility. With a developer-first philosophy, robust feature updates (e.g., SOAP API discovery and endpoint grouping by authentication schemes as of January 2025), and a commitment to staying ahead of evolving threats, Levo.ai stands out as a holistic, scalable solution for enterprises seeking to secure their APIs while maintaining agility and innovation.",2

L,Logic Clutch Software LLP,"91,SHRI RAM ENCLAVE, VATIKA ROAD, SANGANER, SHYOSINGHPURA URF KALLAWALA, BAGRU",Mr. Vikram Jain,Founder,vikram@logicclutch.com,"Logic Clutch is a pioneering Vision AI startup revolutionizing how businesses extract actionable insights from visual data. Our flagship product, LogicEye, transforms ordinary video feeds into real-time business intelligence through advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms.
Founded in 2024 by a team combining expertise in AI research and industry experience, Logic Clutch emerged from a critical observation: despite the proliferation of cameras across business environments, the vast majority of visual data remains unanalyzed and underutilized.
We recognized that visual information represents one of the largest untapped resources for business intelligence. After two years of intensive R&D and collaboration with select industry partners, we developed LogicEye – a platform that doesn't just capture visual data but understands it contextually.
Our journey began with a focus on manufacturing applications, but we quickly recognized the universal need for intelligent visual analysis across industries. Today, LogicEye serves as the visual cortex for organizations seeking to make faster, more informed decisions based on what's happening in their physical environments.

LogicEye stands apart through our proprietary visual cognition engine that:

- Processes and analyzes video streams in real-time with minimal latency
- Integrates seamlessly with existing camera infrastructure
- Employs privacy-preserving technology that processes data at the edge
- Continuously improves through adaptive learning algorithms
- Delivers insights through an intuitive interface requiring minimal technical expertise

The platform combines object detection, behavior analysis, anomaly recognition, and pattern identification into a unified system that converts visual information into structured data streams compatible with existing business intelligence tools.

Market Impact :
LogicEye is driving digital transformation across key sectors:

Manufacturing: Our platform enables real-time production monitoring for quality control, equipment performance tracking, and safety protocol adherence. The system can detect anomalies in manufacturing processes, predict potential equipment failures before they occur, and ensure workplace safety compliance—transforming reactive operations into proactive management.

Retail: LogicEye empowers retailers with unprecedented visibility into store operations and customer behavior. The platform analyzes foot traffic patterns, identifies high-engagement areas, evaluates merchandising effectiveness, and detects potential security concerns. These insights help optimize store layouts, staffing allocations, and product placements for enhanced customer experiences.

Security: We're transforming traditional surveillance into intelligent monitoring by distinguishing between routine activities and suspicious behaviors. LogicEye can identify unauthorized access attempts, detect unusual patterns, and provide real-time alerts for potential security breaches without requiring constant human supervision.

Smart Cities: For urban environments, LogicEye offers solutions for traffic management, public space utilization, and emergency response optimization. The platform can analyze pedestrian and vehicle movements, identify congestion points, and enhance public safety while maintaining individual privacy through advanced anonymization techniques.

Our vision extends beyond traditional video analytics to create truly intelligent visual systems that anticipate needs, predict outcomes, and enable autonomous decision-making in complex environments.

Leadership :
Our multidisciplinary team combines expertise in computer vision, machine learning, hardware optimization, and domain-specific knowledge across our target industries.

Fashion e-commerce brands struggle with stockouts, surplus inventory, and demand miscalculations. A bestseller goes out of stock for weeks, killing momentum. Another SKU lingers in storage, locking up capital. Traditional inventory planning, driven by spreadsheets and gut feel, isnâ€™t enough.

Thatâ€™s where EasyReplenish comes in. We help fashion and accessory brands optimize inventory with data-driven replenishment, ensuring the right stock at the right timeâ€”without overbuying or running out.

Why Fashion Brands Need EasyReplenish
Unlike generic inventory tools, EasyReplenish is built for fashion e-commerce, where styles, sizes, and seasonality make replenishment complex. We factor in:
âœ… Broken styles & cut sizesâ€”Prevent lost sales by tracking stock gaps at the size level.
âœ… Demand spikes & ad trendsâ€”Sync with marketing spend to predict true demand.
âœ… Supplier lead times & MOQsâ€”Optimize POs to balance availability and cash flow.
âœ… Seasonality & sell-through ratesâ€”Stop overstocking last seasonâ€™s trends.

How It Works
EasyReplenish integrates with your e-commerce and ERP systems, tracking 20+ signals to generate timely, automated PO recommendations. No more reactive orderingâ€”get replenishment insights before stockouts happen.

ðŸš€ The Results?
ðŸ“ˆ 8-12% revenue growth by reducing stockouts.
ðŸ'° 15-20% lower excess inventory, freeing up capital.
â³ 50% less manual effort, shifting focus from fixing errors to scaling growth.

Who We Help
We work with brands ranging from $1M to $50M in revenue, managing 100+ SKUs across the US and India. Our clients include fast-growing DTC brands, marketplace sellers, and even Shark Tank-backed businesses.

The Bottom Line
Inventory inefficiencies are silent profit killers. EasyReplenish fixes them. Letâ€™s make sure you never lose another sale to stockoutsâ€”or tie up cash in slow movers.",2

Internet Of food
SmartAgriBlocks is dedicated to accelerating the digital transformation of the Indian agri-food sector

Why?
The Indian dairy industry is the largest in the world, with 300 billion bovines and 76 million diary households. 

While the industry is about $225 billion, 66% of the Indian dairy sector is comprised of smallholder farmers with an average of 1 to 2 cattle. 
The vast majority of India's small and marginal farmers do not have access to institutional credit due to a lack of documented financial transactions 
and awareness of financial services options available to them

current output   - 188 Million metric tonne in 2019
expected growth  - 287 MMT in 2030

It is estimated that the total IN milk production is around 188 million tonnes each year. With around 21 million cows, the IN is the world's largest producer of Milk while EU is largest exporter of cheese and skimmed milk powder. 

As the number of cows in IN is decreasing, the IN dairy sector needs to improve its production process to remain competitive on the world market.

There is a large variety of farm and herd sizes, each requiring their individual approach and solution. However, production differences and the gap between technology levels on dairy farms are quickly decreasing. The sector is rapidly adopting new technological solutions that offer decision support to optimise productivity through enhanced levels of fertility while improving animal welfare. 

This adoption is crucial to decrease the environmental impact and at the same time create more value in the dairy industry to meet the demand for healthy, protein rich products.


Solution

Decentralised Trust in Agri-Food Supply Chains
Implementing blockchain technology to integrate data from stakeholders across the dairy supply chain to improve traceability of milk and milk products.

Innovation

To demonstrate the value of data exchange between stakeholders along the supply chain, we decentralise trust with the use of blockchain technology. 
By implementing and utilising upstream origin's protocols into complex supply chains in the dairy sector, the Memandis innovation Experiment MIE proves the flexibility of the solution whilst at the same time gathering deeper insights into the specificities of the sector.

In the dairy value chain, the objective is to use the trusted data to optimize the payment process for the milk collected from the farmers by a farmer cooperative and then sold to a local dairy. 
In general dairy farmers deliver milk to cooperatives, and in return will receive payments depending on the volume provided, nutritional quality of the milk and specific contractual agreements between farmers and cooperatives. 
This solution help to make this process more transparent and automatic.

Implementation

To make trusted payment calculations for the dairy farms providing milk to the farmers' cooperative
The application includes metadata on all the farmers breeding (a short description of the farm, its location, and a photo representing the farm)
for Processor (food processor and brand owner)
This metadata is paired with traceability information for each batch of milk produced at Processor's facilities.

for consumers to interact with the application, each product is equipped with a QR code which can easily be scanned with any smartphone
Once a consumer scans the code, they are directed to a web-based interface where they are prompted to enter the expiration date of their product and 
the product LOT number indicated on the packaging. 
This prompts the application to present the information on 
the farm location, description, and the other data associated with the product. 
All of the information about the product can be verified by the consumers on the blockchain.

  The Essence

 When used for provenance and traceability, blockchain provides full visibility of data and transactions, facilitates tracking of product.",4

M,MIELO FOOD PRODUCTS PRIVATE LIMITED,"48, Housing board colony,",Mr. Deepak Baghel,Deepak Baghel,deepakbaghel8@gmail.com,"Our Sweet Journey: The Story of Mielo Honey

After graduating from IIT Bombay, Deepak Baghel was eager to find solutions to the pressing challenges in Indian agriculture. In 2016-17, his journey led him to explore the declining effectiveness of pollination, a critical issue affecting farmers across the country. His search for answers brought him into the world of bees—a world where nature's tiniest workers play a vital role in sustaining our food supply. What began as a quest to help farmers and improve crop yields soon turned into a passion for sustainable beekeeping.

It wasn't long before Neha Rai joined Deepak on this mission. Together, they founded Mielo Honey, driven by a shared vision to support Indian farmers and promote natural, sustainable beekeeping practices. What started as a passion project grew into a full-fledged business, with their honey gaining recognition for its purity and quality.

But why ""Mielo""?

The name ""Mielo"" carries a deeper meaning. Derived from the Italian word for honey, ""Mielo"" represents the essence of sweetness, nature, and purity. Much like the bees tirelessly crafting honey in their hives, Mielo Honey is the result of dedication, hard work, and a commitment to excellence. For Deepak and Neha, the word ""Mielo"" symbolizes their mission: to bring the finest, natural honey to people across India while empowering farmers and promoting sustainable agriculture.

With headquarters in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, Mielo Food Products Pvt Ltd has evolved from a simple idea into a thriving business. The company is DPIIT-certified and supported by incubators like IIT Indore's ACE Foundation and IIM Ahmedabad's CIIE Incubation. Today, Mielo continues to grow, offering a range of high-quality honey products and pioneering IoT-based beehive monitoring solutions that enhance honey production and support sustainable practices.

At Mielo, our story is about more than just honey—it's about making a difference in agriculture, supporting our farmers, and bringing the natural sweetness of honey to your table. Join us as we continue this sweet journey.",5

Where clarity takes root.
In an era defined by information overload and complexity, Mool.ai exists to simplify, structure, and supercharge the analytical workflows of professionals in investment, consulting, and corporate strategy.
The word Mool means “root” or “source” in Sanskrit — a nod to our belief that clarity, rigor, and first-principles thinking must be the foundation of great decisions.

We build intelligent playbooks — AI-assisted templates for deep thinking and structured execution. Each playbook is designed to guide professionals through multi-step workflows like market research, due diligence, financial analysis, competitive mapping, strategic planning, and more.

Whether you're breaking down an industry, preparing an investor memo, analyzing quarterly earnings, or evaluating a new market, Mool lets you move from ambiguity to clarity — faster, deeper, and with more confidence.

2. AI That Assists, Not Replaces Mool augments your reasoning, not replace your role. Our engine is designed to enhance professional judgment — helping you explore angles, verify assumptions, generate structured drafts, and make smarter decisions — all while keeping you in control.

3. Structured Workflows That Multiply Output Each template in Mool is a reusable unit of knowledge work. Run them individually for quick insights, or string them together to execute a full project — from discovery to delivery — in a fraction of the time. It's how small teams punch above their weight.

M,Multifly Lifestyle Private Limited,"C-1002, BRIGADE MEADOWS, KAGGALIPURA, KANAKPURA ROAD",Mr. MEHULKUMAR PANCHOLI,CO-FOUNDER,contactus@multifly.co.in,"Who we are:
Multifly Lifestyle Pvt. Ltd. is a Bangalore based social enterprise which designs and develops inclusive clothes for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), senior citizens and patients requiring assistance in wearing clothes. Inclusive clothing is clothing designed around the needs and abilities of people with varying degrees of disability, including congenital disabilities, acquired disabilities, age and temporary disabilities, as well as physical disabilities.
Why do we do what we do:
The idea of Multifly germinated with an ambition to see PwDs employed in mainstream economic enterprises like offices, hospitals, academic institutions, shops & establishments, etc. To get a firsthand experience of the same, we, Brinda and Mehul Pancholi started Multifly in 2021. Brinda has worked in social sector since 2003, and in disability space for a decade now. She volunteers, consults and supports disability NGOs. She is also a member of Governing Board of Biswa Gouri Charitable Trust, Bangalore, which runs Bubbles Center for Autism, Pragati towards Livelihood and Ek Prayas for capacity building of grassroot NGOs. Mehul has worked in fashion and retail industry since 1996. He has worked with stalwarts of fashion industry and played roles in quality assurance, sourcing, product development and innovations. Combining our passions, experience and skills, we started Multifly in 2023. The motto of Multifly is ‘Fashion for PwDs, by PwDs'. 
What do we do:
Through own development center cum studio, Multifly has developed around 50 inclusive garments for catering to the needs of:
PwDs: Children & adults on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Cerebral Palsy, Spinal Cord Injury, locomotor disabilities, vision impairment, dwarfism, severe and multiple disabilities, etc. 
Patients: breast cancer, stroke, colostomy, orthopaedic, frozen shoulders, kidney diseases.
Senior citizens: elderly women and men with very limited mobility or completely bedridden.
How do we work:
Multifly works closely with parents & caregivers, NGOs, hospitals & rehabilitation centers and research institutes to gain insights into challenges and needs of its clientele. Some of them are Biswa Gouri Charitable Trust, EnAble India, Association of People with Disabilities (APD), National Association for the Blind (NAB) Karnataka, Nina Foundation, Jai Vakeel Foundation; IIT Madras & National Center for Assistive Health Technologies (NCAHT), All India Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (AIIPMR), Parents Association of Persons with Cerebral Palsy (PAPCP), Blind People's Association (BPA) and many others.  
Multifly's office is an accessible space for PwDs with ramps, accessible wash room and proximity to Metro & bus service. Our team consists of professionals in garment sector with more than 40 years of experience, sewing machine operators, designer and garment manufacturing technician. We have state of the art sewing machines.
What is Unique about Multifly:
•Choice: The first thing a PwD or a patient or an elderly person robbed off is a choice to decide what to wear. They compromise with what is available (dhoti/ lungi or shorts for men, gown for women), loose clothes for them all, not so well-fitting neighbourhood tailor made clothes. Inclusive garments made by us increase their convenience and choice.
•Dignity: With family and society giving up on hope & expectations from PwDs, their dignity is compromised. Many times, a caregiver's fatigue and frustration result in mal-handling of a PwD whose dignity is compromised. Since our garments are made to fit, made to fulfil their needs and promote lesser dependence on caregivers, the wearer's dignity is ensured. Wearing clothes independently also maintains privacy of grown-up individuals. 
•Independence: Loop & hook closures (popularly known as Velcro©), press buttons, magnetic buttons, zippers, loops & long straps, front, back & side openings, and many similar solutions in inclusive garments support independent living.
•Functional & easy, yet fashionable: Who says fashionable is not functional? Inclusive garments by nature, are functional and easy to wear. And Multifly does just that!  
•Affordable: The price of our garments ranges between Rs. 499 and 2099, which is at par with standard brands available in India.  
•Customization: We know that no two bodies are alike and no two PwDs with same disability have same needs, hence customization. Our products are made, considering the ability and requirement of the user. We take into account the body measurements, body structure, posture and allowance for splints, braces etc. We see the person (in person or through video call/ photo), understand the lifestyle, posture and her needs and then design. Each garment is made especially for that person. With this practice, we have a large variety of the same piece of garment (we have more than 15 styles in trousers!!).",8

Introduction – A Vision for a Greener Future

Nature's Box Pvt. Ltd. is not just a company; it is a powerful movement towards sustainability, innovation, and responsible business practices. With a deep-rooted commitment to environmental well-being, we have pioneered a game-changing startup model that integrates waste management, organic composting, and natural farming into a single, profitable business ecosystem.

Our mission is simple yet profound—to turn corporate waste into wealth, promoting a circular economy that benefits businesses, farmers, and consumers alike.

The Startup Model – Turning Corporate Waste into Gold

Modern corporate hubs generate tons of kitchen waste daily, including:
✅ Vegetable peels and food scraps
✅ Leftover meals from cafeterias
✅ Organic waste from large IT parks, MNCs, and business centers

Most of this nutrient-rich organic waste is discarded into landfills, increasing pollution and contributing to climate change. Nature's Box Pvt. Ltd. has transformed this challenge into a profitable and sustainable business opportunity.

How Our Model Works:

1️⃣ Waste Collection from Corporates

Partnering with IT firms, business hubs, and corporate cafeterias to collect organic waste at scale.

Implementing a structured pickup system, ensuring timely waste management.

2️⃣ Composting & Organic Fertilizer Production

Converting organic waste into high-quality compost using scientific composting techniques.

Utilizing microbial decomposition and vermicomposting for rapid waste transformation.

Ensuring zero chemical intervention—100% pure organic compost.

3️⃣ Using Compost for Sustainable Farming

Employing this nutrient-rich compost in natural farming methods to cultivate chemical-free, high-yield crops.

Focusing on high-curcumin turmeric, organic grains, vegetables, and medicinal plants.

4️⃣ Selling Premium Organic Produce & Compost

Distributing organic farm produce through retail chains, e-commerce, and export markets.

O,OCEANLUX CCU TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED,"92, Arya Nagar, Murlipura",Mr. Gaurav Raghav,Gaurav Raghav,gaurav@oceanlux.in,"Oceanlux CCU: Pioneering the Future of Clean Air & Carbon Capture

Introduction
Oceanlux CCU is a deep-tech startup at the forefront of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) and clean air technology. We are incubated at MNIT Jaipur and iCreate and are developing breakthrough solutions to combat urban air pollution and climate change. Our innovative OceanTree system is a first-of-its-kind microalgae-based air purification and carbon removal technology that works on artificial photosynthesis, actively removing CO₂ and other pollutants 24/7 while generating oxygen.

With rising concerns over indoor and outdoor air quality, OceanTree is positioned as a sustainable alternative to traditional air purifiers, aligning with India's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), CCUS policy, Green Building standards, and the National Bio-Energy Mission.

Technology Behind OceanTree
At the heart of Oceanlux CCU's innovation is artificial photosynthesis, a nature-inspired technology that mimics how trees and plants absorb CO₂ and release oxygen. OceanTree uses specially cultivated high-efficiency microalgae, which are several times more effective than trees in capturing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen.

💡 Key Features of OceanTree:
✅ Removes CO₂, VOCs, PM2.5, PM10, and other pollutants in real time
✅ Generates oxygen equivalent to six mature trees
✅ Works 24x7, unlike natural trees, which only photosynthesize during the day
✅ Modular & Scalable, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications
✅ Self-sustaining & energy-efficient, ensuring low operational costs

The Problem: A Global Air Quality Crisis
Air pollution is a silent killer, with over 99% of the global population breathing unhealthy air (WHO, 2023). Urban spaces such as offices, airports, hotels, hospitals, metro stations, and shopping malls suffer from high indoor CO₂ levels (often exceeding 2000 ppm), leading to:

🔴 Reduced productivity & cognitive function
🔴 Increased health risks—respiratory issues, headaches, fatigue
🔴 Poor air quality impacting well-being in Tier 1 & Tier 2 cities
🔴 Traditional air purifiers only removing dust—not CO₂ or harmful gases

Current solutions fail to address the root cause—CO₂ and toxic gas accumulation—leaving urban populations vulnerable to deteriorating air quality.

The Solution: OceanTree – The Future of Clean Air
OceanTree goes beyond air purification—it transforms air quality by actively removing pollutants and replenishing oxygen.

🌱 Designed for Smart Cities & Green Buildings:
✔ Indoor & Outdoor Applications – Ideal for offices, metro stations, malls, schools, gyms, and hospitals.
✔ Meets National & International Standards – Aligns with NCAP, Green Building Certifications, and CCUS initiatives.
✔ A Natural Replacement for Air Purifiers – While air purifiers only filter dust, OceanTree removes CO₂, VOCs, and airborne toxins.

🌿 Scalable for Urban Sustainability:
🔹 Single-unit impact = Six trees 🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳
🔹 Multiple units create an “Urban Forest” effect
🔹 Helps cities & industries achieve decarbonization goals

Market Size & Opportunity
The global air purification market is expected to reach $30 billion by 2030, with rising demand from urbanization, corporate wellness programs, and government sustainability policies.

🏙️ Market Segments OceanTree Targets:
1️⃣ Indoor Air Quality & Green Buildings – $15B+ market potential
2️⃣ Carbon Capture & Decarbonization – Growing at 20% CAGR
3️⃣ Smart Cities & Infrastructure Projects – Rising investments globally
4️⃣ Healthcare & Wellness Industry – Hospitals, gyms, and offices investing in clean air solutions

With rapid urbanization, climate policies, and increasing awareness of air pollution's health impact, Oceanlux CCU is positioned to become a market leader in sustainable air purification and CCUS solutions.

Introduction
Healthcare access in India is often constrained by financial barriers, especially for outpatient department (OPD) services. Many people delay or avoid medical consultations due to high out-of-pocket expenses. Chqup is a startup dedicated to solving this issue by providing affordable OPD health insurance plans specifically designed for women. By ensuring cost-effective access to specialist consultations, diagnostic tests, and preventive healthcare, Chqup empowers women to take charge of their health while reducing financial stress.
The Problem Chqup Addresses-Healthcare expenses in India are primarily out-of-pocket, with OPD visits and diagnostic tests accounting for a significant share. Many women, especially in middle- and lower-income groups, avoid visiting doctors due to financial constraints. As a result, minor health issues escalate into chronic diseases, leading to prolonged suffering and increased medical costs. Furthermore, preventive healthcare is often overlooked, increasing the burden on both individuals and the healthcare system. Chqup aims to bridge this gap by making OPD healthcare affordable and accessible to all women.
Chqup's Unique Approach
Unlike traditional health insurance plans that primarily cover hospitalization, Chqup focuses on outpatient care. The key differentiators of Chqup's model include:
1.	Women-Centric Plans – Tailored health coverage addressing common OPD needs for women across different age groups.
2.	Affordable Pricing – Cost-effective plans ensuring access to essential medical services.
3.	Easy Accessibility – Direct partnerships with pharmacists to distribute insurance plans, eliminating the need for complex paperwork.
4.	Preventive Healthcare Focus – Coverage for regular check-ups, diagnostic tests, and screenings to encourage early detection and treatment.
5.	Offline Marketing & Word-of-Mouth Strategy – Engaging with local communities through innovative, low-cost marketing strategies.
Target Audience & Market Strategy
Chqup primarily targets women aged 40 and above, categorized in five-year intervals up to 65 years. This demographic often experiences increasing healthcare needs but remains underserved by traditional health insurance models. Chqup's demand generation strategy revolves around:
•	Educating women about OPD coverage benefits.
•	Distributing flyers, pamphlets, and brochures near diagnostic centers and stores.
•	Leveraging free giveaways (such as sarees) to attract attention and spread awareness.
•	Collaborating with pharmacists as distributor partners who guide potential customers toward Chqup's plans.
Challenges and Solutions
Despite a well-structured strategy, Chqup has encountered hurdles, including:
1.	Restricted Access to Medical Institutions – Unable to place marketing materials inside diagnostic centers or train receptionists to promote plans. 
o	Solution: Focus on external distribution, direct pharmacist engagement, and public spaces for marketing.
2.	Lack of Referrals from Family Physicians – Revenue conflicts prevent doctors from recommending Chqup. 
o	Solution: Build trust through pharmacist referrals and customer testimonials to generate organic inquiries.
3.	Low Conversion from Health Camps – Mini health camps did not translate into significant sales. 
o	Solution: Shift towards targeted marketing efforts in high-footfall areas.
4.	Need for Patient-Initiated Inquiries at Pharmacies – Pharmacists need more direct engagement from potential customers. 
o	Solution: Increase community outreach efforts and incentivize pharmacists to promote Chqup actively.
Building Urgency and Desire for OPD Insurance
One of Chqup's primary challenges is making potential customers realize the need for OPD insurance before they face a medical crisis. Strategies to create urgency include:
•	Educating on Cost Savings: Highlighting how OPD insurance significantly reduces long-term healthcare expenses.
•	Real-Life Testimonials: Showcasing stories of women who benefited from early diagnosis and treatment through Chqup.
•	Seasonal Discounts & Limited-Time Offers: Encouraging immediate sign-ups through exclusive promotions.
•	Community Engagement Initiatives: Hosting informative sessions on women's health and preventive care.
Future Roadmap
To expand its impact and reach, Chqup plans to:
1.	Scale Distribution Partnerships – Expanding the network of pharmacists and local health influencers to drive sales.
2.	Leverage Digital Marketing – Incorporating online educational campaigns to complement offline marketing efforts.
3.	Develop Tiered Plans – Introducing varied pricing and benefit tiers to cater to different financial capacities.
4.	Enhance Customer Support – Establishing a dedicated helpline for inquiries and plan assistance.
Conclusion
Chqup is revolutionizing OPD health insurance for women in India by addressing financial barriers and making healthcare accessible. Through a focused,women-centric approah",1

P,PGFY,"IIIT Bangalore Innovation Centre 26/C,",Mr. Naga Sai Jagadeesh Chitroju,Founder,saijagadeesh@thinklogictechsolutions.com,"PGfy: Revolutionizing the Paying Guest Experience in the Property-Tech Sector

PGfy (Paying Guest for You) is a cutting-edge software solution designed to address the challenges faced by paying guest (PG) accommodations and hostels, providing an all-in-one platform for both hostel owners and guests. Our mission is to streamline the PG accommodation process by offering a modern, tech-driven solution that benefits both landlords and tenants. Whether you are a property owner looking to optimize your operations or a student searching for a hassle-free accommodation experience, PGfy is the platform for you.

The Problem: Complexities in the PG System

Traditionally, PG accommodations have been fragmented, with manual processes for booking, payment management, communication, and record-keeping. This often leads to inefficiency, miscommunication, and lack of transparency between hostel owners and tenants. Landlords face challenges in managing guest data, rent collection, maintenance requests, and occupancy status. Meanwhile, tenants are often left to navigate multiple points of contact, leading to confusion and delayed responses.

PGfy's Vision: Simplifying PG Management

PGfy aims to bridge these gaps by providing a seamless platform that simplifies every aspect of the PG accommodation process. From property management and guest booking to payment processing and tenant communication, PGfy offers a unified system that saves time, reduces errors, and improves user experience for all parties involved.

Key Features of PGfy:

Hostel Management Made Easy

Centralized Dashboard: Hostel owners and administrators have access to an intuitive dashboard that gives them an overview of their entire PG accommodation, including guest occupancy, payments, and maintenance requests.

Guest Check-in/Check-out: Streamline guest check-ins and check-outs with real-time updates and notifications. Automatically update room availability and payment statuses to keep everything up to date.

Room Booking: PGfy allows tenants to book rooms online directly through the app, with a transparent view of available rooms, pricing, and amenities.

Seamless Payment Management

Payment Methods: PGfy supports multiple payment methods, including Cash, Credit/Debit Cards, UPI, and more. This flexibility ensures that tenants can pay using their preferred method.

Automatic Payment Reminders: Never miss a payment due date with automated reminders. PGfy helps tenants keep track of their rent payments, while landlords are notified when payments are made.

Invoice Generation: Upon payment, PGfy generates invoices and receipts, making it easier for landlords to maintain records and for tenants to track their payment history.

Transparent Fee and Billing System

Customizable Fee Structures: PGfy allows hostel owners to define different fee structures for various room types, including rent, utilities, and other service charges.

Due Date and Billing Cycle: The system automatically calculates billing cycles, ensuring tenants know exactly when their payment is due and how much they owe.

Split Payments: PGfy supports split payments for multiple tenants sharing a room, making it easier to manage multiple individuals per accommodation.

Guest and Tenant Management

Real-Time Updates: Stay up-to-date with real-time notifications regarding guest arrivals, departures, and maintenance requests.

Tenant Profiles: Create and manage comprehensive tenant profiles with details such as contact information, payment history, and lease terms. This feature helps streamline communication and enhances record-keeping for landlords.

Guest Preferences: Track and save preferences for individual guests, such as special requests, room preferences, or payment methods, to personalize the experience and improve tenant satisfaction.

KYC & Compliance Made Simple

Integrated KYC Verification: PGfy supports KYC (Know Your Customer) processes for verifying tenant identity, which is especially useful for landlords working with third-party verification services or academic institutions.

Legal Compliance: PGfy ensures that all processes, including payment tracking and guest management, comply with the necessary regulations and local laws.

Maintenance and Support

Maintenance Requests: Tenants can submit maintenance requests directly through the app, which are automatically assigned to the relevant personnel. Hostel owners can track these requests in real time, ensuring a quick resolution.

Service Provider Integration: PGfy allows integration with third-party service providers, such as cleaning or repair services, to streamline maintenance operations and ensure high-quality service delivery.

Data Analytics & Reporting Insights and Reports: PGfy provides detailed insights and reports about occupancy rates, financial transactions, guest feedback, and other key performance indicators. These reports can be used to make data-driven decisions to improve hostel operations.",2
P,Phantastic Bioplastics Private Limited,C-104 sector 43,Dr. Priyam Tyagi,Founder,priyam@phantastic.org,"At Phantastic Bioplastics, we are on a mission to transform industrial waste into high-performance, biodegradable Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)—ushering in a new era of sustainable materials. Based in India, our startup is committed to developing cost-effective, scalable, and eco-friendly solutions to replace conventional plastics. By leveraging cutting-edge microbial fermentation technology, we convert waste streams from industries into high-value, home-compostable PHAs, contributing to a truly circular economy.

Why PHAs?
PHAs are a class of biodegradable and biocompatible polymers naturally synthesized by microorganisms. Unlike traditional plastics, which persist in the environment for centuries, PHAs degrade naturally in soil and home compost conditions, reducing long-term waste accumulation. Their versatility, strength, and sustainable production potential make them ideal for replacing petroleum-based plastics in various applications.

Our Innovation: Industrial Waste to High-Value PHAs
One of the biggest challenges in PHA commercialization has been its high production cost. At Phantastic, we address this by using low-cost, renewable waste feedstocks from industrial processes. This innovative approach not only reduces production costs but also helps industries manage their waste more sustainably. Our technology efficiently converts these waste streams into high-quality PHAs that can be customized for different applications through advanced material science.

While PHAs offer excellent biodegradability and environmental benefits, their mechanical properties can sometimes limit widespread adoption. To overcome this, we develop PHA-based blends with other bioplastics, enhancing durability, flexibility, and processability while maintaining full compostability. By combining PHAs with PLA, PBS, PBAT, and starch-based bioplastics, we create materials that are stronger, more versatile, and suitable for a broader range of applications. Our research-driven approach ensures that PHA blends can effectively compete with fossil-based plastics, making them a viable solution for industries such as packaging, agriculture, textiles, and medical applications.",2

P,PuakaAagriAqua,187 LIGH H 1 NEAR 500 BUSSTAND,Mr. DONKINA SANTHOSH,CEO,puakaiagriaqua@gmail.com,"Welcome to PUAKAIAGRIAQUA  – Sustainable Seaweed Farming 
At PUAKAIAGRIAQUA , we are dedicated to cultivating high-quality, eco-friendly seaweed to support sustainable industries worldwide. Our farms operate using regenerative aquaculture methods, ensuring that our oceans remain healthy while providing nutrient-rich seaweed for food, cosmetics, agriculture, and biofuel.
Why Seaweed Farming?
✅ Eco-Friendly: Absorbs CO₂, reduces ocean acidification, and promotes marine biodiversity.
✅ Nutrient-Rich: Packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants beneficial for health and skincare.
✅ Versatile Uses: From plant-based food ingredients to organic fertilizers and bioplastics, seaweed is the future.
Join the Blue Economy Movement
We partner with local communities, scientists, and businesses to promote ethical aquaculture and a sustainable future. Whether you're a chef, entrepreneur, or environmentalist, our seaweed can support your mission.
🌿 How Seaweed Farming Benefits the Environment
1. Carbon Sequestration & Climate Change Mitigation
Seaweed absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere, helping to reduce greenhouse gases and slow down global warming. Some studies suggest that large-scale seaweed farming could offset millions of tons of CO₂ annually.
2. Reducing Ocean Acidification
As CO₂ levels rise, our oceans become more acidic, harming marine life such as coral reefs and shellfish. Seaweed naturally absorbs CO₂ and releases oxygen, helping to balance ocean pH levels and protect marine biodiversity.
3. Boosting Marine Ecosystems & Biodiversity
Seaweed farms provide habitats and nurseries for fish, crustaceans, and other marine species. By restoring underwater ecosystems, seaweed farming supports healthy fisheries and promotes biodiversity.
4. Improving Water Quality
Seaweed acts as a natural water filter, absorbing excess nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus that contribute to water pollution and harmful algal blooms. This makes seaweed farming an effective way to clean coastal waters.
5. Sustainable Alternative to Land-Based Farming
Unlike traditional agriculture, seaweed farming requires no freshwater, fertilizers, or pesticides. It grows naturally in the ocean, making it a zero-input crop that reduces pressure on freshwater resources and land-based ecosystems.
6. Preventing Coastal Erosion
Seaweed farms act as natural wave barriers, reducing the impact of coastal erosion and protecting shorelines from rising sea levels and extreme weather events.
Seaweed: A Superfood Packed with Essential Nutrients 🌿🌊
Seaweed is one of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet, offering a wide range of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Whether consumed fresh, dried, or as an ingredient in supplements, seaweed provides powerful health benefits for the body and mind.
🌿 Key Nutritional Values of Seaweed
1. Rich in Essential Vitamins
✅ Vitamin A – Supports vision, skin health, and immune function.
✅ Vitamin B12 – A crucial nutrient for brain health and energy production (especially important for vegans).
✅ Vitamin C – Boosts immunity and enhances collagen production.
✅ Vitamin E – Acts as a powerful antioxidant for skin and cell health.
✅ Vitamin K – Essential for bone health and blood clotting.
2. High in Minerals for Overall Health
✅ Iodine – Crucial for thyroid function and metabolism regulation.
✅ Calcium – Strengthens bones and teeth, often more bioavailable than dairy.
✅ Iron – Supports red blood cell production and prevents anemia.
✅ Magnesium – Helps with muscle function, nerve signaling, and heart health.
✅ Zinc – Supports immunity and wound healing.
3. Packed with Antioxidants & Anti-Inflammatory Compounds
Seaweed contains powerful polyphenols, flavonoids, and carotenoids that help fight oxidative stress, reduce inflammation, and lower the risk of chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease.
4. Excellent Source of Plant-Based Protein
Some seaweed varieties, such as spirulina and chlorella, are rich in high-quality protein, making them a great choice for vegetarians and vegans.
5. High in Fiber & Supports Gut Health
✅ Seaweed is an excellent source of dietary fiber, aiding digestion and promoting a healthy gut microbiome.
✅ Contains prebiotics that nourish beneficial gut bacteria, improving digestion and immune function.
6. Low in Calories, High in Nutrients
Seaweed is low in calories and fat while being nutrient-dense, making it an ideal superfood for weight management and overall well-being.

At the heart of this transformation is Raheja Solar Food Processing (RSFP), a pioneer in sustainable food preservation through solar dehydration technology.
At Raheja Solar Food Processing (RSFP), we are committed to solving one of the most pressing challenges in agricultureâ€”post-harvest food loss. India, despite being one of the largest agricultural producers, faces a significant issue of food wastage due to inadequate storage and processing facilities. By leveraging solar-powered dehydration, we ensure that no farmerâ€™s hard work goes to waste.
Solar Drying: A Sustainable Solution for Farmers
RSFP designs and manufactures cutting-edge solar dryers that help farmers preserve their produce, reduce wastage, and increase profitability. Unlike conventional drying methods that are time-consuming and prone to contamination, our scientifically designed solar dryers offer a more efficient, hygienic, and sustainable solution. These dryers not only extend the shelf life of fresh produce but also help in retaining their natural color, taste, and nutritional valueâ€”aligning perfectly with the needs of health-conscious consumers
However, our mission extends beyond just providing equipment. We actively engage with farmers, training them on optimal solar drying techniques, guiding them on high-demand products, and offering a buyback policy that ensures they have a steady market for their dried produce. This decentralized approach empowers rural communities, especially women-led self-help groups (SHGs), by providing them with an independent and sustainable source of income.
From Solar-Dried Innovation to Market-Ready Products
Beyond manufacturing solar dryers, we have created a product line that embodies our sustainability vision. Using our solar-powered dehydration technology, RSFP produces natural, preservative-free dried fruits, vegetables, and herbs that cater to both B2B and B2C markets. Our process ensures that the produce retains maximum nutrition while achieving an extended shelf life without the need for artificial additives.

As India's dependence on imported critical metals like Lithium, Cobalt, and Nickel grows, so does the challenge of managing discarded batteries. We transform this challenge into an opportunity by recycling end-of-life batteries to recover high-purity battery-grade materials—reducing reliance on imports while preventing hazardous waste from polluting the environment.

Unlike conventional recycling methods that are costly, chemically intensive, and inefficient, our indigenous technology maximizes recovery rates, consumes fewer chemicals, and makes the process more cost-effective. By pioneering an innovative, environmentally responsible approach, we are ensuring that India's transition to clean energy is not just greener but also self-reliant.

What We Do

At Reproc, we specialize in recycling multi-layered plastics (MLP), including:
	•	Chocolate wrappers
	•	Tetra Pak cartons

Our Products & Applications

The recycled boards produced by Reproc are highly versatile and durable. They are used to manufacture:
	•	Outdoor furniture (benches, tables, chairs, etc.)
	•	Construction materials (partitions, wall panels, flooring)
	•	Retail fixtures (shelves, display units)
	•	Other sustainable products

By offering these alternatives, Reproc provides a cost-effective and sustainable solution for industries looking to reduce their environmental footprint.

Why Reproc?
	•	Environmental Impact: Prevents plastic waste from ending up in landfills, oceans, and incinerators.
	•	Innovation in Recycling: Converts difficult-to-recycle plastics into valuable products.
	•	Sustainable Alternatives: Offers eco-friendly materials that replace wood and reduce deforestation.
	•	Circular Economy Focus: Promotes reusability and waste reduction in manufacturing and design.

S,Saif Automations Services LLP,"1st Floor, Sunrise Incubation Centre, Hill No. 3, Rushikonda",Mr. Aliasgar Calcuttawala,Chief Technical Officer,aliasgar@saifseas.com,"Saif Seas emerged as a pioneering Def Tech startup in 2018, making its mark in India's defense sector through innovation and technological advancements. While the company's journey began with the prestigious iDEX DISC 1 Challenge, its most significant achievement has been its collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) for the design, development, and delivery of high-end Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) capable of communicating with underwater assets.
Saif Seas' advancements in USV technology attracted the attention of DRDO, India's premier defense research institution. DRDO entrusted Saif Seas with a significant project—the development of next-generation USVs that would play a crucial role in naval operations by establishing seamless communication with submarines, underwater drones, and other submerged defense infrastructure.

This project represents a major leap in maritime defense capabilities, as it enables surface and underwater assets to operate in sync, enhancing naval intelligence and combat readiness. The USVs being developed by Saif Seas under this initiative are engineered to incorporate cutting-edge acoustic modems, real-time data transmission systems, and AI-powered autonomous navigation. These features ensure efficient and secure underwater communication, a critical requirement for modern naval warfare.

Furthermore, the USVs feature robust communication systems, high-efficiency propulsion mechanisms, and integrated AI-based navigation, making them ideal for naval and defense applications. The ability of these USVs to autonomously map and relay data to command centers enhances mission planning, threat detection, and real-time decision-making capabilities for the Indian defense forces.

The execution of this project demonstrates Saif Seas' ability to undertake complex defense contracts and deliver mission-critical solutions. It also reinforces the company's position as an industry leader in unmanned maritime systems, paving the way for future collaborations with the Indian defense establishment and international defense agencies.

Building on its technological expertise, Saif Seas ventured into a highly specialized domain—the development of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs). The company participated in the iDEX DISC 7 Challenge, which sought technological solutions for advanced naval operations. Saif Seas' capabilities in autonomous vessel design and maritime technology enabled it to secure a winning position in this challenge.

The USVs developed by Saif Seas feature intelligent, mission-capable designs that allow them to operate in both coastal and deep-sea environments, performing tasks such as reconnaissance, surveillance, hydrographic surveys, and search-and-rescue operations. The seamless integration of dual GNSS positioning, IMU sensors, and real-time AI navigation ensures that these crafts remain fully functional even in challenging conditions.

While the collaboration with DRDO marks Saif Seas' most high-profile engagement, its initial breakthrough came through the iDEX DISC 1 Challenge, where it successfully developed the Remote-Controlled Life Buoy for the Indian Navy. This state-of-the-art, battery-powered, self-propelled device was designed to enhance search and rescue missions, featuring a remote operational range of 1,000 meters, dual jet propulsion, and a lightweight design under 25 kg. The Indian Navy placed an order for 180 units, marking it as the first-ever product developed under iDEX to be inducted into active service.

Saif Seas' journey from a startup to a key defense technology provider is a testament to its commitment to innovation and excellence. While the Remote-Controlled Life Buoy marked its entry into the defense sector, its collaboration with DRDO and expertise in high-end USVs solidified its position as a leader in unmanned maritime technology.

By integrating advanced engineering, AI-driven automation, and real-time communication systems, Saif Seas is setting new benchmarks in the development of unmanned maritime assets. With a clear vision for the future, the company continues to push the boundaries of defense technology, ensuring that India remains at the forefront of maritime innovation. As Saif Seas expands its expertise and technological offerings, it is poised to play a crucial role in shaping the future of naval defense and autonomous maritime operations.",1

S,Sandee Foods,"Flat No 3041, Tower 2, Block B, GH-7, Crossing Republic",Mr. Naveen Verma,Manager,pinki@sandeefoods.com,"Sandee Food: Where Tradition Meets Taste
Imagine a world where your food is preserved without a single chemical, where every bite bursts with natural flavor, and where ancient wisdom meets modern health standards. Welcome to Sandee Food, a pioneering company that's turning this vision into a delicious reality. With a bold mission to completely eliminate chemical preservatives from our diets, Sandee Food is redefining food preservation by harnessing the power of ancient Indian methods. These time-honored techniques not only maintain the original aroma and taste of food but also naturally enhance its shelf life, offering a perfect fusion of heritage, health, and innovation.
At Sandee Food, preservation is an art rooted in tradition. Drawing from centuries-old practices, the company employs natural methods such as sun-drying, fermentation, and the strategic use of organic preservatives like salt, oils, and spices. These techniques, perfected over generations, ensure that every product remains free from harmful artificial additives while delivering an authentic sensory experience. Fermentation, for instance, not only extends shelf life but also enriches food with probiotics, aiding digestion and enhancing nutritional value. Sun-drying locks in flavors and vitamins, while spices and oils add depth and aroma—proving that nature alone can preserve food beautifully.
In an industry where chemical preservatives dominate, often at the expense of health and taste, Sandee Food stands as a beacon of purity. Chemical additives may prolong shelf life, but they come with risks—potential allergies, digestive issues, and long-term health concerns. Sandee Food eliminates these worries entirely, offering a safer, cleaner alternative that prioritizes well-being without compromise. The result? A diverse range of products—from tangy pickles to aromatic dried fruits and savory snacks—that taste as fresh and vibrant as nature intended.
This unwavering commitment to quality has not gone unnoticed. Sandee Food boasts the highest ratings for taste, a testament to its ability to deliver unparalleled flavor in every bite. Customers rave about the rich, authentic profiles of its offerings, setting them apart in a crowded market. This acclaim is matched by remarkable customer retention, with a loyal following that returns time and again. Whether it's the zesty kick of a naturally preserved condiment or the wholesome crunch of a sun-dried snack, Sandee Food has cultivated a community of discerning food lovers who trust in its promise of excellence.
But Sandee Food's mission transcends the plate. By reviving ancient Indian preservation methods, the company is also a custodian of cultural heritage. Each product tells a story—of ingenuity, resilience, and the wisdom of ancestors who mastered the art of keeping food fresh without synthetic aids. This dedication connects modern consumers to India's rich culinary past, making every meal a celebration of tradition. From the bustling spice markets of history to today's health-conscious kitchens, Sandee Food bridges centuries with every jar, packet, and tin it produces.
Sustainability is another cornerstone of Sandee Food's ethos. Unlike industrial preservation processes that rely on energy-intensive machinery and chemical production, these traditional methods have a lighter environmental footprint. Sun-drying harnesses renewable energy from the sun, fermentation thrives on natural microbial activity, and organic preservatives sidestep the ecological toll of synthetic alternatives. This eco-friendly approach aligns with Sandee Food's broader vision: to nourish not just its customers but the planet as well.
As Sandee Food continues to grow, its resolve remains unshaken—to provide food that's naturally preserved, authentically flavored, and deeply nourishing. It's more than a business; it's a movement towards a healthier, tastier, and more sustainable future. Whether you're a retailer seeking quality products, a partner eager to support a noble cause, or a consumer hungry for real flavor, Sandee Food invites you to experience the difference. Taste the past, savor the present, and join a revolution that proves good food doesn't need chemicals—just tradition, care, and a touch of ancient magic.",2

India is dealing with an increase in the mental health crisis particularly for its youth. There is a steady increase in the number of student suicides according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) with over 13000 cases reported in 2021 alone. There are number of factors like academic pressure, social expectations, financial stress and personal challenges leading to a spike in anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation among students.
Traditional therapy primarily relies on talk therapy which is often inadequate for individuals struggling with expressing emotions or social stigma surrounding mental health. Many students experiencing distress hesitate to openly address their issues making it challenging for psychologists to provide timely intervention. Furthermore students experiencing mental health distress may be hesitant to seek help due to lack of awareness of available resources. There is an urgent need for accessible, stigma-free and effective early intervention mechanisms on the campus to prevent stress/anxiety from escalating into severe mental health disorders/suicides.

About AdagioVR
AdagioVR can serve as an effective tool to bridge this gap offering an alternative, immersive intervention that allows students to engage with mental health support in a non-verbal manner. AdagioVR offers a game changing trauma-focused, multi-sensory digital therapeutic delivered through Virtual Reality (VR) that provides immediate relief from stress/anxiety. It also creates a safe, non-judgmental environment where students can process and regulate their emotions effectively.  A few sessions with AdagioVR can help students be more receptive to discussing their issues with the specialists.

Key Benefits

S,SaraSan Health & Hygiene Pvt.Ltd.,"466/252, Baghambari Housing Scheme,",Mr. Ashwini Tripathi,Chief Executive Officer,connect@sarasan.in,"SaraSan Health & Hygiene Pvt Ltd – Revolutionizing Affordable Ayurvedic Healthcare

SaraSan Health & Hygiene Pvt Ltd is a pioneering Ayurvedic healthcare startup committed to delivering affordable health through Ayurveda. In a world where healthcare costs are rising, and people are seeking natural, side-effect-free solutions, SaraSan stands as a beacon of trust, bringing authentic, effective, and reasonably priced Ayurvedic products to the masses.

With a strong foundation in traditional Ayurvedic wisdom and a modern, research-driven approach, SaraSan develops products that cater to everyday health concerns—from digestive wellness to pain relief. Unlike many Ayurvedic brands that focus on premium, high-end markets, SaraSan ensures that its solutions are within reach for every household, making Ayurveda a practical part of daily life.


---

Problems SaraSan Health & Hygiene Pvt Ltd is Solving

1. Expensive Healthcare Solutions

One of the biggest challenges in the healthcare industry is the high cost of effective treatment. While Ayurveda offers natural remedies, many premium brands market their products at prices that exclude a large segment of the population.

SaraSan disrupts this trend by offering high-quality Ayurvedic formulations at affordable prices, ensuring that people don't have to choose between health and financial burden.

For example:

Udar Sanjeevni – A quick-relief Ayurvedic drop for gas and acidity, priced affordably so that every household can access it without hesitation.

Neerja Oil – A fast-acting pain relief oil that provides instant relief in muscle spasms and pulls, making it a must-have for families, athletes, and elderly individuals.


By ensuring affordability, SaraSan is making natural healthcare solutions a viable alternative to expensive allopathic treatments that often come with side effects.

2. Rising Digestive Issues & Lifestyle-Related Problems

Modern lifestyles, with irregular eating habits, processed foods, and stress, have led to an increase in gut health issues like acidity, bloating, indigestion, and constipation. Many people rely on chemical-based antacids and laxatives, which provide temporary relief but don't address the root cause.

SaraSan tackles this problem with:

Udar Sanjeevni – A potent blend of Ayurvedic herbs that provides instant relief from acidity and gas, supporting long-term digestive health.

Saral Tablets & Powder – A gentle, herbal solution for constipation, improving bowel movement without the side effects of synthetic laxatives.


By providing safe and effective digestive wellness solutions, SaraSan helps individuals transition to natural, sustainable gut health management.

3. Pain Management Without Side Effects

Millions suffer from chronic pain, muscle stiffness, and joint issues due to aging, strenuous work, or injuries. Conventional pain relief options, such as painkillers and chemical-laden ointments, can have severe long-term side effects, including liver damage and dependency.

SaraSan addresses this with:

Neerja Oil – A unique 4-drop formula that provides instant relief from muscle pain, spasms, and strains. Unlike heavy, greasy pain relief oils, Neerja is lightweight, non-sticky, and highly effective, making it ideal for household use.

With a focus on safe and natural pain management, SaraSan empowers individuals to avoid harmful chemicals and embrace Ayurveda's power for long-term relief.

4. Making Ayurveda Accessible for Everyday Use

A significant issue with many Ayurvedic products is that they are complex to use, time-consuming, or unfamiliar to modern consumers. People often associate Ayurveda with long treatment cycles, bitter-tasting medicines, and traditional decoctions, making them hesitant to adopt it.

SaraSan changes this perception by offering:

Easy-to-use, fast-acting Ayurvedic solutions that fit seamlessly into modern lifestyles.

Convenient packaging and clear instructions to ensure that even first-time users can benefit without confusion.

Products designed for instant and practical relief, rather than requiring prolonged consumption to see results.


By bridging the gap between ancient wisdom and modern convenience, SaraSan is making Ayurveda more accessible and user-friendly.


5. Bringing Ayurveda to the Masses – Large-Scale Distribution

SaraSan Health & Hygiene Pvt Ltd is more than just an Ayurvedic brand—it is a movement towards affordable, natural, and effective healthcare. By focusing on real consumer needs, mass accessibility, and Ayurvedic authenticity, SaraSan is reshaping the way people experience holistic wellness.

S,Sarvdhan,"J-1004, MALABAR COUNTY 1, CHHARODI",Mr. VARUN KUMAR,Co-Founder,varun@sarvdhan.com,"Sarvdhan – Powering Secured Lending in Bharat

Sarvdhan is a new-age secured lending platform on a mission to transform the way Bharat—semi-urban and rural India—accesses credit. Focused primarily on used vehicle finance, Sarvdhan bridges the gap between traditional lenders and underserved borrowers through a tech-led, data-driven, and distribution-first approach.

Founded by Varun and Arpit, seasoned professionals with nearly 15 years of experience across banking, NBFCs, and fintech, Sarvdhan was built on the belief that access to finance in Bharat needs more than just digital apps—it needs trust, local understanding, and human touch.

What Sarvdhan Solves
In smaller towns and rural pockets, borrowers often struggle with:
   Lack of formal credit history
   Limited access to organised lenders
   Inadequate documentation
   Poor customer experience

Sarvdhan simplifies this journey through its POS platform, empowering local agents, channel partners, and sales teams to source, assess, and submit secured loan proposals in minutes. The system supports multiple secured products with a special focus on used commercial and private vehicle loans—a core asset for Bharat's micro-entrepreneurs.

Key Highlights
Built for Bharat: Deep focus on tier 2-4 towns with multilingual, low-tech interfaces
Tech + Touch: Combines AI-driven decision tools with strong on-ground presence
SCOPE Credit Report: Sarvdhan's proprietary loan assessment scorecard that blends borrower intent, repayment behavior, and asset quality
Fast Origination: ~8 Cr loans disbursed in a single month—testament to scalable processes and high partner trust

Trusted by Investors: Backed by IIMA Ventures with ongoing funding conversations underway

Why Sarvdhan Stands Out
Unlike generic fintechs focused on metros, Sarvdhan is designed ground-up for the realities of rural and semi-urban lending. Its edge lies in:

   Deep domain expertise in secured lending
   Smart onboarding and credit decision workflows
   Real-time document and asset checks
   Partner-first incentives and transparency
   API integrations with lenders, insurance providers, and vehicle data sources

The Road Ahead:
Sarvdhan aims to become the OS for Secured Lending in Bharat—powering banks, NBFCs, DSAs, and fintechs to lend better, faster, and more confidently. With a growing partner network, expanding product lines, and a strong technology backbone, Sarvdhan is poised to reshape how India borrows beyond the metro bubble.

S,Satiq Concrete Manufacturer Private Limited,"IITM RESEARCH PARK, 1FA, I FLR, KANAGAM ROAD, TTTI TARAMANI,  CHENNAI CITY CORPORATION",Dr. Shantanu Bhattacherjee,Director,shantanu@scmconcrete.com,"The cost and carbon footprint of concrete are largely influenced by its cement content. Since standardized alternatives to cement are not widely available, it is rarely replaced in actual construction projects. However, SatiQ is developing standardized alternatives that can replace 30% to 70% of cement using waste materials sourced from within 150 kilometers of the production plant. We adopt a waste-agnostic approach, processing waste based on its chemistry and utilizing data to produce binders that can substitute for cement. The integration of cement chemistry, concrete technology, and AI/ML-based data processing helps optimize the cement content in our products.
Utilization of Locally Available Waste for Alternative Binders
We utilize waste found within a 150 km radius of the manufacturing site based on its chemical composition. Any waste containing amorphous calcium, alumina, silica, or other binding properties is processed to develop the alternative binder. Our solution is waste-agnostic, and we mix processed wastes to create the alternative binder. This approach enhances the circularity of waste materials, as concrete is a high-volume material used in construction.
Performance-based Standardized Alternative Binders and Concrete
The alternative binder and concrete produced are standardized for specific properties, regardless of the nature of the waste used as input. These alternative binders are designed to enhance the performance of concrete, improving strength, durability, and ease of application based on local requirements. Cement content can be reduced by 30% to 60% for structural applications and by up to 90% for non-structural concrete, which significantly decreases the overall carbon footprint of construction projects.
Data-driven Approach for Concrete Mix Development
We employ machine learning and artificial intelligence to tailor the alternative binder and optimize the concrete mix design for a higher cement replacement rate.
Real-time Data Measurement for Quality Control during Production 
We utilize an IoT-enabled sensor system for real-time data measurement during the concrete production process. This technology standardizes concrete production and employs a data-driven approach to ensure higher reliability and quality control.",3

The Benefits of Seaweed
Seaweed is often called the ""green gold of the ocean"" for its exceptional versatility and benefits. Here's why we believe in its potential:
•	Environmental Benefits: Seaweed absorbs carbon dioxide and nutrients, helping combat ocean acidification and eutrophication.
•	Economic Impact: The global seaweed industry is rapidly expanding, creating new opportunities for coastal economies.
•	Health Advantages: Seaweed is a superfood packed with essential nutrients and antioxidants.
•	Industrial Applications: Its derivatives, such as alginates and carrageenan, are indispensable in food processing, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.
Seaweed farming is an activity that aligns with global sustainability goals and offers tremendous potential for scaling positive impact.
What We Do
SeaViz Agri Tech operates across multiple domains to ensure holistic growth and impact:
Seaweed Cultivation
Our team employs advanced techniques and sustainable farming practices to cultivate diverse seaweed species. These species are not only rich in nutrients but also have a broad range of industrial and agricultural applications. Through rigorous research and innovation, we optimize the cultivation process to ensure maximum yield while protecting marine biodiversity.
Processing and Product Development
Once harvested, the seaweed undergoes a sophisticated transformation process. Our state-of-the-art facilities convert raw seaweed into high-value products, including:
•	Bio-fertilizers: Organic solutions for enhancing soil fertility and crop productivity.
•	Plant Growth Stimulants: Natural products that promote healthier and more resilient crops.
•	Animal Feed Supplements: Nutrient-rich additives that support livestock health and productivity.
•	Food-Grade Carrageenan: A versatile additive used in the food industry for its thickening and stabilizing properties.
By catering to diverse industries, we maximize the potential of seaweed as a sustainable resource while contributing to a greener economy.
Coastal Community Empowerment
We believe that the heart of sustainability lies in community involvement. Our initiatives are designed to uplift marginalized coastal populations, particularly women, by:
•	Providing comprehensive training in sustainable seaweed farming techniques.
•	Offering infrastructure support and access to resources.
•	Creating steady employment opportunities that enhance household incomes and livelihoods.
Through these efforts, we aim to build self-reliant communities capable of driving long-term change.
Environmental Conservation
Seaweed farming is inherently sustainable and eco-friendly. It requires no freshwater, fertilizers, or pesticides and actively absorbs carbon dioxide, making it a potent tool for mitigating climate change. Our projects also enhance marine biodiversity by creating habitats for aquatic life, ensuring the health of coastal ecosystems.

Often when kids pitch in with the household chores, the simple task of folding clothes becomes a tent making competition. Wiping the kitchen counter ends up in us making a spontaneous snack. Scrubbing the floor becomes a dance fest and more often than not, those little fumbling feet and bumbling hands may lead to situations where the cleaning never ends. 

But every day, what never stops is the growing, the bonding, the learning and the laughing.

A mum from New Delhi started Koparo with a single goal of making effective, plant-powered cleaning & hygiene products that are safe to use in all homes.

NO NASTIES. ONLY BESTIES.
We've ensured we don't put anything in our products that you wouldn't let your kids touch. And so, we searched and found the most powerful plant-based ingredients that take the fight to dirt, grime and germs and packed them in good measure in our cleaners. We avoid using non biodegradable ingredients that are potentially harsh for you and certainly harmful for the planet. Go on and get them to fight against the dirt, guilt free!

Our products are manufactured in a state of the art facility with WHO approved Good Manufacturing Practices to deliver you a consistent quality standards across our range.

GOODNESS THAT ONLY GIVES
We have nothing to hide and will tell you all about the ingredients - their names and what is their source. 

We hate the bad stuff - ammonia, chlorine, phosphates, EDTA, bleach, triclosan and artificial colours as these have been linked to several short & long term health issues including breathing discomfort, allergies, hormone imbalances, and even cancer. 

Considering how these can adversely affect us, our loved ones and the environment, we have devised a formulation that is eco-friendly, kid safe and pet safe. Our formulations are PETA certified 100% vegan and cruelty-free.

We have ensured that while being naturally sourced and plant-based, our non-toxic* products do what they are supposed to do well in the first place i.e. clean effectively.",7

 We believe that fostering curiosity, nurturing creativity, and developing problem-solving skills is true essence of education. At Skillonation Kids, we believe in the Art of Questioning, the ability to ask ""Why?"" and explore beyond textbooks. Millions may have seen the apple fall, but it was Newton who asked why. This fundamental trait of curiosity has shaped human civilization, innovation, and progress.

Who We Are

Skillonation Kids is a holistic development-based skilling platform dedicated to revolutionizing the way children learn. We focus on fostering critical thinking, creativity, and hands-on problem-solving. Our mission is to help young learners build a strong foundation in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) while encouraging them to explore their individual passions and interests.

At Skillonation Kids, we blend theory with practicality to ensure an interactive and engaging learning experience. We strive to create an ecosystem where students are not just passive learners but active problem-solvers, thinkers, and innovators. With project-based learning methodologies, task-driven approaches, and hands-on experiences, we equip children with the necessary skills to thrive in an evolving world.

We are proud to be incubated with iStart, which has enabled us to scale our efforts in promoting innovation, entrepreneurship, and skill development on a larger scale. Our initiatives have made an impact at various state levels as co-partners, organizers, and coordinators, helping students gain exposure to real-world challenges.

Our Mission and Vision

At Skillonation Kids, our mission is to transform education into an act of curiosity. We believe that every child is unique and should be given the opportunity to question, explore, and innovate. Our goal is to create a learning environment where students are encouraged to think beyond textbooks, develop their creative potential, and build practical skills that will prepare them for the future.

Our vision is to provide courses that enhance both the left and right brain of children. While the left brain focuses on logic and analytical thinking, the right brain fosters creativity, artistic expression, and visualization. True innovation happens when both sides of the brain work together, allowing children to become well-rounded individuals.

We are trailblazers in India, promoting the STEAM-based approach for the holistic development of students. By integrating Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics, we move beyond the traditional rote-learning system and focus on practical education, allowing students to experiment, create, and discover their passions.

We believe that questioning is the foundation of learning. Our programs encourage students to ask ""Why?"" and ""How?"", helping them develop logical reasoning, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.

2. Project-Based Learning

Rather than relying on passive learning methods, we incorporate project-based learning, where students get to build their own projects. This hands-on approach helps them understand concepts better, retain knowledge longer, and develop craftsmanship skills.

3. Task-Based Approach

Our unique task-based learning methodology ensures that students apply what they learn. Instead of merely memorizing concepts, they work on practical tasks that challenge them to think, create, and innovate with Design Thinking

4. Hands-On Learning Kits

To make learning even more engaging, we offer project-based kits that allow students to experiment and explore concepts through real-world applications. These kits provide an interactive and immersive learning experience.

5. Affordable and Accessible Courses

Our courses are designed to be affordable and flexible, catering to students from diverse backgrounds. We have vernacular coding platform 'à¤• à¤¸à¥‡ à¤•à¥‹à¤¡à¤¿à¤‚à¤—' to bridge gap between theoretical education and practical skills.

S,Sleepy Owl Coffee Pvt Ltd,"74, Link Road, Lajpat Nagar III",Mr. ARMAN SOOD,Co- Founder,arman@sleepyowl.co,"Sleepy Owl Coffee Private Limited is a leading Indian coffee company that has redefined the coffee-drinking experience by offering premium, easy-to-brew, and freshly roasted coffee products. Founded in 2017 by Arman Sood, Ashwajeet Singh, and Ajai Thandi, the company was created with the vision of bringing cafÃ©-style coffee experiences to homes. The founders, frustrated with the lack of quality coffee options for home consumption, aimed to introduce products that offered convenience without compromising on taste and freshness. This led to the launch of cold brew coffee packs, which became the brandâ€™s flagship product. Unlike traditional hot-brewed coffee, cold brew involves steeping coffee grounds in cold water for 12-24 hours, resulting in a smoother, less acidic beverage with rich flavors. The product was an instant success, appealing to coffee lovers seeking convenience and quality.

Over time, Sleepy Owl expanded its product portfolio to cater to the diverse preferences of coffee enthusiasts. The company introduced hot brew bags, offering the convenience of tea bags but with freshly ground coffee, making it easy to enjoy a rich and aromatic brew without the need for complex equipment. To meet the rising demand for quick and flavorful coffee, the brand launched instant coffee in various flavors, providing a fast yet satisfying alternative for busy consumers. The ready-to-drink (RTD) cold brew bottles became a popular grab-and-go option, catering to urban professionals looking for a quick caffeine fix. Additionally, Sleepy Owl introduced coffee concentrates, allowing consumers to easily prepare lattes, iced coffees, and other beverages with minimal effort. Every product is made from 100% Arabica beans, sourced directly from Indian farmers, ensuring freshness, consistency, and ethical sourcing.

Sleepy Owlâ€™s direct-to-consumer (D2C) business model has been instrumental in its growth. By selling directly through its website, the company offers fresher products, competitive pricing, and personalized customer experiences. In addition to its online store, Sleepy Owlâ€™s products are available on major e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, BigBasket, and Blinkit, making them accessible to coffee lovers across India. The company has also expanded into offline retail, partnering with supermarkets and gourmet stores, further strengthening its market presence. This omnichannel strategy allows Sleepy Owl to cater to both online and offline consumers effectively.

Marketing has played a key role in the companyâ€™s success. Sleepy Owl leverages social media platforms, influencer partnerships, and creative content to engage with its audience. The brandâ€™s marketing campaigns emphasize the lifestyle and convenience associated with coffee consumption, making it highly relatable to millennials and Gen Z consumers. The company also prioritizes sustainability, using eco-friendly packaging and promoting fair trade practices by sourcing directly from farmers.

With ambitious expansion plans, Sleepy Owl aims to diversify its product range and enter international markets. Its focus on quality, convenience, and sustainability has made it a trusted name in the Indian coffee industry, with a growing customer base that appreciates its commitment to providing cafÃ©-quality coffee at home.",8

MIN-X and MIN-X Pro X-Ray Modules :- 

The MIN-X and MIN-X Pro X-Ray Modules by STARNUKE are advanced, indigenous solutions above 80% local content. These modules showcase our commitment to local manufacturing, reducing overseas dependency and promoting self-sufficiency in the X-ray technology sector.

Key components such as the high-frequency voltage generator are fully designed and manufactured at our Jaipur facility, with only select electronic components (IGBT, MOSFET, capacitors, etc.) sourced from local suppliers in Bangalore and Delhi. The process of transformer winding, leakage testing, vacuuming, oil filling, and final calibration is performed in-house. Additionally, the program software and firmware (Software Development Kit - SDK) are developed by STARNUKE, ensuring optimized performance and user interface integration.

The MIN-X and MIN-X Pro modules also benefit from locally produced PCBs, which undergo rigorous quality control at a Delhi-based facility, and custom-designed enclosures manufactured using STARNUKE-owned dies at a local injection molding company. These local manufacturing practices enable quicker repairs, faster part availability, and enhanced customization.

Technologically, both models offer significant advantages: higher X-ray energy, better penetration for sharper images, and increased storage and heat capacity for durability during extended use. The MIN-X Pro further excels with wireless charging, touchscreen operation, and variable kV/mA control via Anatomical Programmed Radiography (APR), making it versatile for different radiological examinations.

Certified by all relevant Indian regulatory bodies, these X-ray modules are designed to provide superior image quality, ease of use, and reduced downtime. STARNUKE continues to lead the way in building indigenous, high-performance X-ray systems for the healthcare sector.",11

Start-Tech Academy is solving this challenge by offering affordable, up-to-date, and job-ready learning programs focused on bridging the skill gap.

Our Story:
Start-Tech Academy was born out of real industry experience. While working as project managers in leading global analytics and telecom firms, our co-founders identified a serious disconnect in the Indian job market. On one hand, businesses were urgently hiring for roles in data science and emerging tech, while on the other, students were unsure about what to learn and where to start. This realization inspired us to create a platform that simplifies learning and enables employment.

What We Offer:
Our platform provides a comprehensive portfolio of online, self-paced courses designed to equip learners with industry-relevant skills. The courses fall under six major categories:

Generative AI
Machine Learning
Data Analytics
Cybersecurity
Management Analytics
Data Visualization

Each course is built using a standardized, research-backed framework and is regularly updated to match changing industry needs. In addition to individual learners, we also serve businesses through:

Corporate Training: Custom programs to upskill teams in analytics, AI, and cybersecurity

Consulting: Helping organizations leverage data to solve business problems and make better decisions

What Makes Us Different (USP):

Speed, Quality & Relevance
The tech landscape evolves rapidly. We've built a lean, agile content creation model that allows us to produce and update high-quality training quickly. Our focus is on content and learning outcomes, not just marketing.

Truly Affordable Education
While other platforms charge ₹20,000+ for similar programs, our courses are priced at just ₹400, making them accessible to everyone—from students in small towns to working professionals looking to upskill.

Our Growth Potential:
The demand for professionals trained in analytics and AI is exploding. In just the last two years, job openings in these fields have quadrupled. Start-Tech Academy is uniquely positioned to serve this rising demand due to factors such as:

Widespread internet access across India

Growth of the remote work and online education culture

Increasing recognition of the need for lifelong learning

A strong value-for-money proposition in a price-sensitive market

Our Team's Strength:
Our co-founders combine strong academic backgrounds with deep industry experience. In just over 2 years, the Start-Tech Academy team has built a thriving community of over 20 lakh students from 170+ countries, delivering real impact and career transformation.",11

Designed for children aged 0-8 years, our garments are made from 100% pure cotton, ensuring comfort, breathability, and sustainability.  

Each outfit is inspired by timeless Indian folktales, Panchatantra stories, and cultural heritage, featuring unique story-driven prints. To enhance the storytelling experience, every garment comes with a complimentary flipbook, allowing children to engage with the stories behind their outfits.  

Key Features & Benefits:
Story-Inspired Prints – Designs based on Indian folktales, teaching values through fashion.  
100% Cotton & Skin-Friendly – Soft, breathable fabric, perfect for kids' sensitive skin.  
Sustainable & Zero-Waste Packaging – Packaging transforms into creative DIY crafts.  
Interactive & Educational – Clothing that sparks curiosity, imagination, and learning.

Nursery & Decor Items – Themed bedding and room decor for kids.  Workshops & Community Engagement – Storytelling and creative art workshops.  
By blending culture, creativity, and sustainability, Story Tailor is redefining kids wear, ensuring every outfit tells a story worth wearing.
In today's market, kids wear is dominated by Western designs, cartoon characters, and fast fashion, leaving little room for culturally rich, meaningful, and sustainable options. Parents looking for comfortable, high-quality, and educational clothing often struggle to find options that align with their values.
Additionally, the fast fashion industry is a major contributor to environmental waste, and children's clothing, which is frequently outgrown, adds to this cycle. There is a growing demand for eco-friendly, ethically made kids wear that balances style, comfort, and sustainability.
Another gap in the market is the lack of engagement between children and their cultural roots. With digital distractions on the rise, traditional Indian folktales and values are fading from everyday life. Parents often want to pass on stories from Panchatantra, Jataka tales, and other cultural narratives, but they lack engaging ways to do so.

How Story Tailor Solves This Problem
1)Fashion Meets Storytelling – Story Tailor integrates Indian folktales into kids wear through story-driven prints and complimentary flipbooks, making clothing educational and engaging.
2)100% Cotton & Sustainable Clothing – Our garments are eco-friendly, breathable, and gentle on kids' skin, ensuring comfort without compromising on quality.
3)Zero-Waste Concept – Our innovative packaging transforms into DIY crafts, reducing waste and promoting creativity.
4)Supporting Women Artisans – We work with women-led tailoring units, providing employment and fair wages, making a social impact. Bridging the Cultural Gap – By blending fashion, stories, and learning, Story Tailor helps children connect with their heritage in a fun, interactive way.

The Impact
Sustainable & Eco-Friendly – Reducing waste and promoting mindful consumption.
Educational & Engaging – Clothing that nurtures curiosity and creativity.
Empowering Women – Supporting artisans and ethical production.
Story Tailor is not just a clothing brand—it's a movement to make kids wear more meaningful, sustainable, and culturally rich.",12

S,Swadha Agri Pvt Ltd,"Vill. Jorkat, PO: Sua",Ms. Neha Bharti,Founder & CEO,neha@swadhaagri.com,"Imagine an industry in India which is 400 Billion USD employing over 80 Million population, contributing to 5% of country's GDP, and still remains unorganised upto 90%. Thats dairy. Globally this market is 1600 Billion USD growing at a CAGR of 15%.

Despite such a huge market size and 55 years of White Revolution, over 3/4th of the sector is unorganised. Why? One simple answer, non-availability of a dedicated cow-to-consumer technology solution. Federations and private dairies still rely on manual or semi-manual processes for milk procurement, processing, and distribution, leading to high overheads and lower operational efficiency. 

This sparked our journey on the tough grounds of Palamu, one of least developed cities of India. We didn't have a “dairy supply chain manual” to follow to address this gap. So, we rolled up our sleeves and experienced every challenge firsthand: for farmers, customers and logistics. This real-world crash course helped us evolve from manual process in 2021 to a fully automated technology platform in 2023. 

Unlike many solutions that focus on isolated processes, Swadha integrates the entire dairy supply chain with three interconnected apps: one each for Farmer, Logistics and Customer- all synced to a central dashboard for complete supply chain visibility. 

Our platform reduces overhead costs by 60% and boosting efficiency by 90%. In our POC in Palamu we have successfully processed over 1/2 a million procurements and deliveries, generating revenue exceeding 350 thousand USD.

By offering our platform on recurring revenue model to cooperatives and dairy companies on white-label, plug-and-play and fully customizable model, our vision is to position ourself as a leader in transforming dairy supply chains in India and globally.

Every sheet, every towel, every fabric is a testament to artisanal craftsmanship and thoughtful design—soft to the touch, breathable against the skin, and effortlessly elegant. We believe that true luxury doesn't scream—it whispers. It's in the details, the feel, the experience.

A Commitment to Craftsmanship

Imagine a game where you don't just control a character—you build, customize, and command your own battle bot in an electrifying robot boxing arena. The Boxing Bots isn't just a game—it's a high-stakes robotic showdown where your skills, strategy, and reflexes define the outcome.

But here's the catch: To dominate the arena, you have to engineer your own champion.

The Thrill of the Game: Build. Fight. Win.
The Boxing Bots is a real-world robot battle where players assemble, program, and battle their own custom-built machines.

🔥 Customize & Upgrade – Modify your bot's design, movement, and attack strategies.
🔥 Compete in Real-Time Matches – Outsmart your opponents in fast-paced robotic duels.
🔥 Master the Mechanics – Learn how movement, sensors, and AI-driven decisions affect battle outcomes.
🔥 Climb the Leaderboard – Rise through the ranks, challenge champions, and earn rewards.

The competition is fierce, but the thrill? Unmatched.

The Secret Weapon? Curiosity Fuels Mastery
What makes The Boxing Bots different from any other game? You're not just playing—you're creating, experimenting, and innovating.

🏆 Curiosity Sparks Innovation – Players quickly realize that tweaking their bot's movement, improving reaction time, and understanding its mechanics directly affect their performance in battle.
🏆 Competition Drives Mastery – The more you play, the more you refine your bot's speed, agility, and attack sequences. Learning happens organically, driven by the desire to win.
🏆 Failure is Feedback – Every loss is a chance to rethink, reprogram, and re-enter stronger. Unlike passive learning, this is an adaptive, high-engagement experience.

The Byproduct? You Just Learned Robotics Without Realizing It
While players focus on winning battles, something incredible happens in the background:

✅ They learn engineering by designing their bot's mechanics.
✅ They develop coding skills while programming attack sequences.
✅ They explore AI & IoT as they refine bot behavior for strategic combat.
✅ They embrace problem-solving through real-time decision-making.

What starts as a game evolves into an immersive STEM learning journey—without the pressure of a classroom.

Reason for our existence

We deeply care about the individuals we support, and we want you to understand the impact of your purchase. By buying our products, you help mainstream these artisans, and by raising awareness, you help prevent their marginalization.

Building a Sustainable Organization

We aim to create a self-sustaining organization, moving away from charity. NGOs and beneficiaries often rely on charity funds, which can diminish their drive for independence. With many chasing the same limited funds, new ideas and methods often struggle to find financial support. Livelihood initiatives should be designed to be sustainable.

Earning a Living Is Empowering

Having an income is more than just having money; it's liberating and boosts confidence. Poverty is the root cause of many social issues, from gender-based abuse to urban migration. While money isn't everything, it's essential for purchasing necessities like education and health, and it provides the dignity of making one's own decisions. At jhappi, we strongly advocate for income generation and strive for better, bigger, and continuous markets for our makers.

Sympathy Selling is momentary

A sale made because of the social cause it supports has limited scalability. Focusing on aping the commercial product market fit is the game changer. We believe an umbrella should be sturdy and withstand heavy showers for three seasons and add to the style as it's a mandatory accessory for a few months. The fact that its made by people with disabilities is the much needed icing on the cake – it's not the USP (Unique selling proposition) but can be a (UBP – Unique Buying Proposition). Tasteful storytelling creates the pull.

The TCB Story

TCB Infotech started with a simple observation: Most businesses are working hard, but not smart.

Founded by Rishab Gupta, a passionate technologist and visionary entrepreneur, TCB was born out of a desire to solve real-world business inefficiencies using technology. After spending years working with various industries, Rishab noticed a recurring pattern: outdated manual processes, scattered software tools, and a desperate need for unified, intelligent systems.

From humble beginnings in Hisar, Haryana, TCB Infotech began its journey with a strong focus on business process automation, starting with ERPNext and later expanding into Odoo, SAP, and AI-powered solutions. With a growing team and an even bigger vision, the company soon started serving clients not just across India, but also internationally.

Today, TCB Infotech stands tall as a leader in digital transformation, with a client base that spans diverse sectors—from finance to manufacturing, education to healthcare, retail to agriculture. We've automated more than 40+ businesses, delivered 25% average efficiency boosts, and helped companies achieve a 40% ROI increase on their digital investments.

But we're just getting started.

T,Thrafford Lifescience,"A-905, Plot No. A-40, Unit No. 5, Sector 62",Dr. Kadalmani Krishnan,Chief Executive Officer,kk@thrafford.com,"Thrafford Lifescience is addressing the growing oncology crisis in India, where there are approximately 250,000 cases of leukemia and lymphoma, and 30% of these patients are refractory or relapsed. While CAR-T cell therapy has shown significant promise in treating hematologic cancers, its adoption in India remains low, with fewer than 300 patients treated annually. This limited access is primarily due to challenges around scalability, affordability, and the complex manufacturing process of CAR-T therapies.

To overcome these barriers, Thrafford is focusing on the development of allogeneic CAR-T therapy. Unlike autologous CAR-T, which requires harvesting and processing a patient's own T-cells, allogeneic CAR-T therapy utilizes T-cells from healthy, unrelated donors. This approach enables the creation of ""off-the-shelf"" therapies that can be produced in bulk and stored, thus significantly reducing manufacturing costs and time. With allogeneic CAR-T, the scalability of treatment is greatly improved, allowing for rapid and cost-effective availability to more patients.

A key aspect of this development is the need for indigenous reagents and consumables tailored to the Indian healthcare context. Currently, the availability of suitable reagents and systems for efficient CAR-T manufacturing is limited as majority of them are either imported or non-GMP grade. Thrafford is actively working on creating local, cost-effective reagents and consumables that are optimized for allogeneic CAR-T production. These innovations will help streamline manufacturing, improve the consistency and quality of the product, and ensure that the therapies are more accessible in India and other developing regions.

Thrafford's commitment to advancing allogeneic CAR-T therapy, coupled with the development of indigenous reagents and consumables, aims to overcome existing challenges and make CAR-T treatments more affordable and scalable. This approach promises to bring groundbreaking cancer therapies to a broader patient population, particularly in underserved regions like India, where the need is critical.",5

Tinkle Jewels is more than just a jewelry brand—it's a movement dedicated to artistry, empowerment, and sustainability. Established in 2023, our brand was born from a deep passion for handmade craftsmanship and a vision to create a positive social impact. We specialize in crafting handmade, customized, and unique jewelry and decorative items that celebrate creativity and tradition.

Our Story & Mission

The journey of Tinkle Jewels began in a small yet determined way. Inspired by a love for art, nurtured by an art-teacher mother and a creative grandmother, we transformed our passion into a purpose-driven brand. Recognizing the struggles of skilled but unemployed women, especially migrants, we made it our mission to train and empower women artisans by providing them with sustainable employment.

Starting with limited investment from a middle-class family, we overcame financial constraints and built Tinkle Jewels step by step. With guidance from an incubation center, we developed essential business skills, enabling us to turn a small-scale initiative into a growing enterprise.

Empowering Women Through Craftsmanship

One of our core values is women's empowerment. We have trained over 50 women artisans, many of whom migrated in search of better opportunities. Out of these, 15+ women have found stable employment through Tinkle Jewels, helping them gain financial independence and confidence.

By providing skill development, fair wages, and a supportive work environment, we aim to create a sustainable livelihood for women while preserving the art of handmade jewelry. Each piece we craft is a testament to their dedication and resilience.

Handmade Creations with a Purpose

At Tinkle Jewels, we take pride in our handcrafted jewelry and decor, each piece carrying a personal touch. Our products are designed with love and care, ensuring uniqueness and quality. From intricate jewelry pieces to customized accessories and home decor, our collections reflect a blend of traditional craftsmanship and modern aesthetics.

What makes our brand special?

Handmade & Customizable – Every piece is crafted by skilled hands and can be personalized.

Ethically Made – We ensure fair wages and ethical production practices.

Women-Led & Empowering – Every purchase supports women artisans and their families.


Growing Through Challenges

Like any entrepreneurial journey, building Tinkle Jewels has not been without obstacles. From financial limitations to artisan migration, we have faced challenges in sustaining and expanding our operations. However, our perseverance, coupled with the support of our customers and well-wishers, has helped us grow steadily.

We have successfully sold our products through wholesale markets, jewelry shops, private exhibitions, and stalls, making handmade artistry accessible to a wider audience.",5

V,VayuDrishti,Seshmati,Mr. Shakriya Pandey,CEO,pandayshakriya@gmail.com,"About Us – VayuDrishti

At VayuDrishti, we envision a world where everyone breathes clean air—free from the invisible threats of pollution. Founded with a passion for environmental justice and technological innovation, VayuDrishti is a Nepali-born initiative committed to tackling one of humanity's most pressing challenges: air pollution. By combining real-time air monitoring and purification solutions, we are pioneering a movement toward cleaner, healthier, and more informed communities.

Our Mission

We are on a mission to make air quality visible, understandable, and actionable. Our integrated approach focuses on two pillars:

Accurate, Low-Cost Air Monitoring
Accessible, Effective Air Purification
By delivering end-to-end solutions—from monitoring to mitigation—we help individuals, institutions, and governments take meaningful action against air pollution.

What We Do

1. Air Quality Monitoring: Our flagship product is a low-cost, high-accuracy air quality monitoring system that tracks PM2.5, PM10, CO₂, temperature, humidity, ground ozone, and wind parameters in real time. Built for scalability and affordability, our device is ideal for urban neighborhoods, rural areas, schools, public offices, and industries. The data is visualized on our responsive dashboard and is also accessible through public APIs, enabling broader data-driven decisions.

2. Air Purification Systems: Recognizing that monitoring alone isn't enough, we've developed community-scale and indoor air purification systems. Designed specifically for Nepali environments, our purifiers reduce PM levels, neutralize harmful gases, and improve indoor air in classrooms, homes, hospitals, and offices. Our purification systems are energy-efficient, low-maintenance, and adaptable to various space sizes.

Together, these systems allow us to both diagnose and treat the problem of polluted air—making us a comprehensive air quality solution provider.

Why It Matters

Air pollution silently shortens lives, particularly in South Asia where millions are exposed to dangerously high levels of PM2.5. The lack of accessible monitoring and purification infrastructure limits awareness and response. At VayuDrishti, we close that gap. We equip communities with the knowledge and tools to see the problem and protect themselves from it.

Our solutions are not only technical—they are social. We focus on behavior change through education, data transparency, and community engagement.

The VayuDrishti Ecosystem

Monitoring Devices: Portable, easy-to-install units sending real-time data to our cloud.
Purifiers: Classroom-friendly, plug-and-play systems filtering particulate matter and VOCs.
Dashboard: Interactive platform displaying live AQI levels, trend graphs, alerts, and air health recommendations.
Workshops: Air quality literacy programs in schools, communities, and municipalities, empowering citizens to interpret and respond to air data.
AI-Driven Forecasting: Our upcoming platform will use AI models to forecast pollution levels and recommend personalized actions.
Values That Drive Us

Innovation with Purpose: We innovate not for complexity, but for clarity and accessibility.
Equity: We prioritize underserved regions, ensuring everyone has the right to breathe safely.
Sustainability: Our devices are energy-efficient, cost-effective, and designed for long-term use.
Transparency: We make our data open and understandable, believing knowledge is power.
Future Vision

VayuDrishti is scaling into an environmental intelligence company with a global footprint. Our roadmap includes:

Deployment of 10,000+ air monitors and 2,000+ purifiers by 2030
Smart home air quality systems integrated with IoT
AI-based health and pollution alerts tailored to individual exposure
Expansion into forest fire, dust storm, and transboundary pollution forecasting
As we grow, our focus remains grounded: cleaner air, better health, and empowered communities.

Another prominent feature of this technology is that. It can be integrated with existing Induction motors to reduce their wattage consumption by 40 to 50 Percent with the same efficiency and output, just by installing a few of its components on them. That costs around a few hundred, and your old motor gets upgraded to energy energy-efficient one.
The third benefit associated with this. It supports the motor manufacturing ecosystem of our country.
With this I mean to say that lots of SME and MSMEs manufacture induction motors in our country, we just have to empower them with our Bipolar motors and they can manufacture energy-efficient motors within in same production Line.

Today's writers frequently switch between multiple LLMs—such as ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and LLaMA—copying and pasting results, managing fragmented workflows, and facing constant friction when collaborating or scaling their writing process.

Most LLM platforms don't offer a usable editor at all—DeepSeek, for example, lacks one entirely. Others, like ChatGPT's Canvas, offer basic editing interfaces but fall short on core capabilities: limited document length, poor support for long-form writing (like full Wikipedia-style articles), and no way to integrate multiple models in the same environment. Mixing outputs from different LLMs or using local models for secure workflows is nearly impossible in such setups.

inkk.ai solves these problems by bringing all major LLMs into a single, seamless writing environment. It supports real-time, multi-user collaboration, handles long documents with ease, and allows users to mix and match models or agents—including locally hosted LLMs—based on their task or security needs.

It is also the only platform offering a dedicated AI agent marketplace for writing and research. Users can create and share their own specialized agents—whether tailored for creative writing like horror fiction, or optimized for accurate, technical content generation.

This avoids the need for scattered tools across dozens of open browser tabs and elevates productivity. The editor can even be embedded into external websites for complete workflow integration.

 GRAPHENE. Our initial objective is to make graphene material inexpensive and readily
 available to all the potential industry sectors in our country. Our mission is to give our
 customers with quick turnaround times, outstanding quality, unparalleled customer
 service, and affordable price.
 To address the pressing issues of plastic waste accumulation and resource scarcity, we
 propose an innovative method to transform municipal Bio and plastic waste into valuable
 graphene and graphene based products. Our approach offers a sustainable solution for
 plastic waste management by diverting it from landfills and reducing its environmental
 impact. The generation of graphene from Bio-waste and plastic waste can contribute to a
 more sustainable and circular economy (Waste to wealth). This could lead to increased
 public support for the project and enhance the region's reputation as a leader in
 sustainable development.
 By converting Biomass & plastic into valuable materials, we contribute to a circular
 economy, which promotes resource conservation and reduces the reliance on virgin
 materials. This not only helps to mitigate climate change but also protects ecosystems and
 biodiversity. By investing in the production of graphene, the region can position itself as a
 leader in the emerging field of sustainable materials. This could attract foreign investment,
 foster collaboration with international research institutions, and enhance the region's
 reputation as a hub for innovation and technological advancement. 
In addition to these direct economic benefits, the production of graphene can also have
 indirect positive effects on the local economy. For example, it could stimulate growth in
 related industries, such as manufacturing, transportation, defence research and energy
 storage. Furthermore, it could lead to the establishment of new facilities like manufacturing
 plants and research institutes. Which could benefit the region in the long term.",3

Our Mission and Vision

Webadvisor's mission is simple yet powerful: Educating business owners about the importance of secure and professional communication.

Our goal is to create a business ecosystem where organizations embrace secure, cloud-based solutions for enhanced efficiency and protection.

Why Secure Business Communication Matters

Enhanced Security: Free email services are vulnerable to phishing attacks and hacking. A professional email ensures data protection and encrypted communication.

Brand Credibility: Customers trust businesses that use professional email domains.

Improved Collaboration: Google Workspace offers seamless integration with tools like Google Drive, Calendar, and Meet.

Regulatory Compliance: Industries with stringent compliance requirements benefit from secure cloud storage and email solutions.

Y,Yield Pro Earth Private Limited,"1st Floor, GIDC Industrial Estate,",Mr. Ram Mehta,Ram Mehta,yeildproearth@gmail.com,"Business Description for Yield Pro Earth
Right now, India has many small and marginalized farmers. Due to a shortage of funds and a lack of necessary irrigation facilities, farmers are still using the age-old trench techniques. Which in turn uses up a lot of electricity. Thus resulting in a huge waste of water and electricity. And so the Government has to give both water and electricity subsidies so that the farmers can do farming at a lower cost. This resulted in a huge loss to the government, which was the tune of crores of rupees. In the age of modernization, farmers in our country cannot have a definite count on their yield and can barely meet their own familyâ€™s needs. 
We have manufactured a Flexible Irrigation Pipe which is an economical, recyclable, sustainable, and easy-to-use irrigation pipe that can be directly attached to the water source. Unlike the traditional trench techniques and rigid water irrigation pipes which require a heavy investment as well as a fixed infrastructure around which the crops are to be grown or rotated. Also, the current rigid piping systems available in the market today, our product is 1/10th the cost and has no infrastructural requirement which makes it a more convenient and cheaper source of irrigation for the farmers with better results at a cheaper rate which in turn boosts the farmers profits.",1

Traditional software tools often burden enterprises with repetitive data entry and complex integrations. Our vision is simple: “No More Software Overload, Just Real Work Done.” We create digital workers—capable of learning from your data, connecting to CRMs, ERPs, or external APIs, and continuously improving.
